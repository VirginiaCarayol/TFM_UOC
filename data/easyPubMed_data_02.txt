Depression is one of the most common psychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), and several studies have shown that oxidative stress plays a key role in 
the etiopathology of both AD and depression. Clinical studies indicate reduced 
efficacy of the current antidepressants for the treatment of depression in AD. 
In this regard, agmatine emerges as a neuroprotective agent that presents 
diverse effects, including antidepressant and antioxidant properties. Here we 
investigated the antioxidant and antidepressant-like effects of agmatine in a 
mouse model of AD induced by a single intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) 
administration of amyloid-β 1-40 (Aβ). Mice were treated with agmatine 
(10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) once a day during seven consecutive days. The 
first administration of agmatine was 24 h before the i.c.v. injection of 
aggregated Aβ 1-40 (400 pmol/mouse). Ten days after Aβ injection, mice were 
evaluated in the forced swimming test (FST) and open field test for assessment 
of depressive-like behavior and locomotor activity, respectively. Oxidative 
parameters were evaluated in the hippocampus of mice 24 h after Aβ injection. 
Agmatine prevented Aβ-induced increase in hippocampal lipid peroxidation levels 
and Aβ-induced decrease in catalase activity. In addition, agmatine prevented 
the increase in immobility time in the FST and the decrease in the latency to 
the first immobility episode induced by Aβ, without changing locomotion in the 
open field test. These results demonstrate the antioxidant and 
antidepressant-like effects of agmatine in a mouse model of AD, indicating the 
potential of agmatine for the treatment of depression associated to AD.

Recent studies have suggested that cortical astroglia play an important role in 
depressive-like behaviors. Potential astroglial contributions have been proposed 
based on their known neuroplastic functions, such as glutamate recycling and 
synaptic plasticity. However, the specific mechanisms by which astroglial cells 
may contribute or protect against a depressive phenotype remain unknown. To 
delineate astroglial changes that accompany depressive-like behavior, we used 
astroglial-specific bacTRAP mice exposed to chronic variable stress (CVS) and 
profiled the astroglial translatome using translating ribosome affinity 
purification (TRAP) in conjunction with RNAseq. As expected, CVS significantly 
increased anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors and corticosterone levels and 
decreased GFAP expression in astroglia, although this did not reflect a change 
in the total number of astroglial cells. TRAPseq results showed that CVS 
decreased genes associated with astroglial plasticity: RhoGTPases, growth factor 
signaling, and transcription regulation, and increased genes associated with the 
formation of extracellular matrices such as perineuronal nets (PNNs). PNNs 
inhibit neuroplasticity and astroglia contribute to the formation, organization, 
and maintenance of PNNs. To validate our TRAPseq findings, we showed an increase 
in PNNs following CVS. Degradation of PNNs in the prefrontal cortex of mice 
exposed to CVS reversed the CVS-induced behavioral phenotype in the forced swim 
test. These data lend further support to the neuroplasticity hypothesis of 
depressive behaviors and, in particular, extend this hypothesis beyond neuronal 
plasticity to include an overall decrease in genes associated with cortical 
astroglial plasticity following CVS. Further studies will be needed to assess 
the antidepressant potential of directly targeting astroglial cell function in 
models of depression.

Currently, there is keen interest in the development of alternative therapies in 
the treatment of depression. Given the explosion of research focused on the 
microbiota-gut-brain axis, consideration has turned to the potential of certain 
probiotics to improve patient outcomes for those suffering from mood disorders. 
Here we examine the abilities of a known antidepressant, fluoxetine, and the 
probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus JB-1™, to attenuate responses to two 
established criteria for depressive-like behavior in animal models, the tail 
suspension test (TST) and the corticosterone response to an acute restraint 
stressor. We examine two different strains of mice known to differ in the extent 
to which they express both anxiety-like behavior and measures of despair-BALB/c 
and Swiss Webster-with respectively high and normal behavioral phenotypes for 
each. While adult male BALB/c mice responded with increased antidepressive-like 
behavior to both fluoxetine and L. rhamnosus JB-1 in both the TST and the 
corticosterone stress response, SW mice did not respond to either treatment as 
compared to controls. These findings highlight the importance of investigating 
putative antidepressants in mouse strains known to express face validity for 
some markers of depression. Clinical studies examining the activity of L. 
rhamnosus JB-1 in patients suffering from mood disorders are warranted, as well 
as further pre-clinical work examining how interactions between host genotype 
and intestinal microbial alterations may impact behavioral responses. This study 
adds to the literature supporting the possibility that modifying the intestinal 
microbiota via probiotics represents a promising potential therapeutic 
breakthrough in the treatment of psychiatric disease.

Background: The apelin-APJ system has been considered to play a crucial role in 
HPA axis function, and how the traditional Chinese compound prescription 
Xiaoyaosan regulates the apelin-APJ system as a supplement to treat depressive 
disorders. Objective: To investigate the depression-like behaviors and 
expression of apelin and APJ in hypothalamus of chronic unpredictable mild 
stress (CUMS) mice and study whether these changes related to the regulation of 
Xiaoyaosan. Methods: 60 adult C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into four 
groups, including control group, CUMS group, Xiaoyaosan treatment group and 
fluoxetine treatment group. Mice in the control group and CUMS group received 
0.5 mL physiological saline once a day by intragastric administration. Mice in 
two treatment groups received Xiaoyaosan (0.25 g/kg/d) and fluoxetine (2.6 
mg/kg/d), respectively. After 21 days of modeling with CUMS, the expression of 
apelin and APJ in hypothalamus were measured by real-time fluorescence 
quantitative PCR, western blot and immunohistochemical staining. The physical 
condition, body weight, food intake and behavior tests such as open field test, 
sucrose preference test and force swimming test were measured to evaluate 
depressive-like behaviors. Results: In this study, significant behavioral 
changes were found in CUMS-induced mice, meanwhile the expressions of apelin and 
APJ in the hypothalamus were changed after modeling. The body weight, 
food-intake and depressive-like behaviors in CUMS-induced mice could be improved 
by Xiaoyaosan treatment which is similar with the efficacy of fluoxetine, while 
the expressions of apelin and APJ in hypothalamus were modified by Xiaoyaosan. 
Conclusions: The data suggest that apelin-APJ system changes in the hypothalamus 
may be a target of depressive disorders, and the beneficial effects of Chinese 
compound prescription Xiaoyaosan on depressive-like behaviors may be mediated by 
the apelin-APJ system.

We earlier reported that the male mice lacking the Wdr13 gene (Wdr13-/0) showed 
mild anxiety, better memory retention, and up-regulation of synaptic proteins in 
the hippocampus. With increasing evidences from parallel studies in our 
laboratory about the possible role of Wdr13 in stress response, we investigated 
its role in brain. We observed that Wdr13 transcript gets up-regulated in the 
hippocampus of the wild-type mice exposed to stress. To further dissect its 
function, we analyzed the behavioral and molecular phenotypes of Wdr13-/0 mice 
when subjected to mild chronic psychological stress, namely; mild (attenuated) 
social isolation. We employed iTRAQ based quantitative proteomics, real time PCR 
and western blotting to investigate molecular changes. Three weeks of social 
isolation predisposed Wdr13-/0 mice to anhedonia, heightened anxiety-measured by 
Open field test (OFT), increased behavior despair- measured by Forced swim test 
(FST) and reduced dendritic branching along with decreased spine density of 
hippocampal CA1 neurons as compared to wild-type counterparts. This 
depression-like-phenotype was however ameliorated when treated with 
anti-depressant imipramine. Molecular analysis revealed that out of 1002 
quantified proteins [1% False discovery rate (FDR), at-least two unique 
peptides], strikingly, a significant proportion of synaptic proteins including, 
SYN1, CAMK2A, and RAB3A were down-regulated in the socially isolated Wdr13-/0 
mice as compared to its wild-type counterparts. This was in contrast to the 
elevated levels of these proteins in non-stressed mutants as compared to the 
controls. We hypothesized that a de-regulated transcription factor upstream of 
the synaptic genes might be responsible for the observed phenotype. Indeed, in 
the socially isolated Wdr13-/0 mice, there was an up-regulation of GATA1 - a 
transcription factor that negatively regulates synaptic genes and has been 
associated with Major Depression (MD) in humans. The present study demonstrates 
significant genotype × enviornment interaction for Wdr13 gene as shown by the 
reversal in the expression levels of several synaptic proteins in the mutant 
vis-à-vis wild-type mouse when exposed to social isolation stress.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of depressive symptoms is higher in cancer patients. 
And depression can also affect the occurrence, development and outcome of cancer 
through the neuroendocrine-immune-network system.
OBJECTIVE: To study the level of Nesfatin-1 in the plasma and brain tissue and 
its role in the pathogenesis in gastric cancer comorbid with depression using a 
mouse gastric cancer model.
METHODS: 18 mice were randomly divided into the normal control group (NCG), 
gastric cancer without stress model group (GCNS), and gastric cancer combined 
with stress model group (GCS). The mice of the GCNS group were inoculated 
subcutaneously with mouse forestomach carcinoma (MFC) after 5 weeks of nomal 
feeding to establish a model of subcutaneous transplantation tumor. After 5 
weeks of chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS) in the GCS group, subcutaneous 
inoculation of MFC was used to establish a subcutaneous transplantation tumor 
model for 1 week. Evaluation of mice behavior was performed by open field test, 
sucrose preference test and forced swimming test (FST). Determination of 
Nesfatin-1 concentration in plasma and brain tissue was carried out using enzyme 
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western Blot.
RESULTS: The weight increment in the GCS group was significantly lower than that 
in the GCNS group (t=-3.39, p<0.001). And both GCS and GCNS were lower than the 
NCG group (t=-6.33, p<0.001; t=-2.94, p=0.01). In the open field test, the 
horizontal moving distance of the GCS group was less than that of the GCNS group 
(t=-2.50, p=0.025), and both GCS and GCNS were smaller than the NCG group 
(t=-5.87, p<0.001; t=-3.38, p=0.004). The dead time of the GCS group was longer 
than that of the GCNS and the NCG groups (t=2.56, p=0.022; t=3.84, p=0.002). The 
Nesfatin-1 level in the middle brain, hippocampus and plasma was significantly 
higher in NCG group and GCS group than in the GCNS group. The concentration of 
Nesfatin-1 in the GCS group was significantly higher than that in the NCG group.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a decrease of Nesfatin-1 level in brain tissue and plasma 
in mice with gastric cancer without stress. CUMS stress can induce depressive 
behavior in gastric cancer mice, and increase the level of Nesfatin-1 in brain 
tissue and plasma. Therefore, Nesfatin-1 may be related to the pathogenesis of 
gastric cancer stress related depression.

＜ 0.001; t = -2.94, p=0.01)；旷场试验中GCS 组水平 移动距离小于GCNS 组（t = -2.50, p = 0.025）, 
且GCS、 GCNS 两组二者均小于NCG 组（t = -5.87, p ＜ 0.001； t = -3.38, p = 0.004）；GCS 
组不动时间长于GCNS 组与 NCG 组(t = 2.56, p = 0.022; t = 3.84, p = 0.002)。中脑、 
海马及血浆Nesfatin-1 水平NCG 组与GCS 组均显著高 于GCNS 组，且而GCS 组Nesfatin-1 浓度显著高于正常 
对照组，结果均有统计学意义。.
结论: 胃癌不合并应激抑郁小鼠脑组织及血浆 Nesfatin-1 水平降低，CUMS 应激可以引起胃癌小鼠的 
抑郁样行为，且可以升高脑组织及血浆Nesfatin-1 水平， 因此Nesfatin-1 可能与胃癌及胃癌相关应激抑郁的发病 有关。.

Polygala japonica Houtt. (PJ) has been reported have positive effect on the 
nerves system including depression, but the underlying mechanism is needed to be 
understood. Here we show that PJ counteracts behavioral effects induced by 
chronic restraint, a model of depression mimicking exposure to stress, through 
adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) enhancement. Chronic stress increased the 
immobility time in the tail suspension test (TST) and forced swim test (FST) and 
decreased the time in the center of elevated plus maze (EPM) relative to 
controls. Moreover, chronic stress also induced the cognitive deficit in novel 
object recognition test, object location test and barnes maze. These behavioral 
alterations were accompanied by the decreased AHN. Treatment with PJ reversed 
the behavioral and AHN alterations. We also found that PJ had no significant 
effect on cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation in dentate gyrus (DG) 
of the hippocampus, but it inhibited the apoptosis of the newborn neurons by 
activation of bcl-2 and phopho-erk1/2 and increased the number of the newborn 
neurons. Our results demonstrate that administration of PJ to chronic stress 
mice alleviates depression-like behaviors and normalizes the deficit in 
hippocampal neurogenesis with inhibiting newborn neuron apoptosis.

BACKGROUND: Chronic fatigue patients experience various neuropsychological 
symptoms, including fatigue behaviors, chronic pain, and depression. They also 
display immune system dysregulation. Polygonum aviculare L. extract (PAE) is a 
traditional herbal medicine used to treat inflammatory diseases by reportedly 
decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokine production.
HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: We hypothesized that the anti-inflammatory properties of PAE 
would attenuate fatigue symptoms in a mouse model of restraint stress.
STUDY DESIGN: We evaluated the effects of PAE on fatigue using three 
experimental groups: unstressed, vehicle-treated stressed, and PAE-treated 
stressed mice. This restraint stress paradigm, comprised of restraint for 3 h 
daily for 15 days, was used to model chronic fatigue.
METHODS: We compared lethargy-like behavior between our experimental groups 
using forced-swim, sucrose preference, and open-field tests once per week on 
days 7 and 14 of restraint stress. We also used histology and western blotting 
to evaluate pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in the brain and serum, and 
microglial activation in the brain. Finally, we used liquid chromatography/mass 
spectroscopy (LC/MS) to identify individual components of PAE, and applied cell 
culture techniques to test the effects of these components on neuronal cells in 
vitro.
RESULTS: In restraint-stressed mice, PAE treatment decreased lethargy-like 
behavior relative to vehicle-treated animals. PAE treatment also reduced 
expression of fatigue-related factors such as corticosterone, serotonin, and 
catecholamines (adrenaline and noradrenaline) in the brain and serum, and 
decreased expression of CD68, Ibal-1, and the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, 
IL-6, and IL-1β in the brain. Together, these data indicate that PAE reduced 
fatigue and is anti-inflammatory. Furthermore, histopathological analyses 
indicated that PAE treatment recovered atrophic volumes and hepatic injuries. 
Finally, LC/MS analysis of PAE identified four individual chemicals: myricitrin, 
isoquercitrin, avicularin, and quercitrin. In neuronal cell cultures, treatment 
with these PAE components inhibited TNF-α production, confirming that PAE 
treatment reduces neuroinflammation.
CONCLUSIONS: PAE treatment may reduce fatigue by suppressing neuroinflammation 
and the expression of fatigue-related hormones.

Geniposide (GP), a bioactive iridoid glycoside isolated from Gardenia 
jasminoides Ellis, as well as an agonist of Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor 
(GLP-1R), has been reported to exhibit antidepressant-like effects in several 
rodent models. However, the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. In this study, 
we mainly investigated the antidepressant-like effects of GP and explored the 
possible mechanisms associated with GLP-1R signaling by using the repeated 
restraint stress (RRS)-induced depression model of mice. We found that GP 
treatment significantly ameliorated depression-like behaviors induced by RRS, 
such as decreased sucrose preference (SP) in sucrose preference test (SPT), 
reduced locomotor activity in open field test (OFT) and extended immobility time 
in tail suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test (FST). In addition, GP 
suppressed the neuronal apoptosis as well as reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines 
levels including Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in 
the hippocampus of RRS-induced mice. Moreover, GP restored the expression of 
GLP-1R/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling-related protein. Importantly, these 
effects were blocked by an antagonist of GLP-1R, Exendin(9-39) (Ex(9-39)), 
indicating that GLP-1R signaling pathway might be involved in the 
neuroprotective and antidepressant-like effecacy of GP. In conclusion, GP 
exerted promising antidepressant-like effects in RRS mice, and the 
antidepressant-like action of GP might be closely relevant to GLP-1R/AKT 
signaling.

Inflammation recently has been considered to be participated in the pathogenesis 
of major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the detailed mechanism of 
inflammation in depression has not been completely understood yet. In the 
present study, depression mice model was established by chronic social defeat 
stress (CSDS) method and confirmed by behavior examinations including forced 
swimming test and sucrose preference test. The decrease of spine density and 
postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) in hippocampus further verified the 
depression model. Then, the microglia polarization state and endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER) stress were investigated. At transcriptional level, M1 marker 
(inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), CD16, CD86, CXCL10) in CSDS mice was 
higher than that in control group while there was no difference in M2 marker 
(Arginase and CD206) between two groups. And it was observed in the hippocampus 
of CSDS induced depression mice that increased activated microglia was merged 
with iNOS instead of arginase by immunofluorescence staining. Furthermore, the 
M1 marker Interleukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were increased 
in depression mice while the M1 marker IL-6 and M2 marker IL-10 remained 
unchanged. The expression of ER stress signaling factors, including protein 
kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK), Phosphorylated α-subunit of eukaryotic 
translation initiation factor 2(p-eIF2α), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), and 
X-box binding protein 1(XBP1) were significantly higher in CSDS-induced 
depression mice than in control mice. In all, our results suggest that M1 
polarization and ER stress play a vital role in MDD pathogenesis.

Depression triggered by early-life stress has begun to attract wide attention 
due to its severe symptoms and poor treatment outcomes. However, the 
pathophysiological mechanism for this type of depression remains unclear. 
Recently, we and others reported that different types of chronic stress induce a 
significant loss of hippocampal microglia, which is mediated by an initial 
activation of these microglia. Since early-life stress also promotes microglial 
activation, we investigated the dynamic changes in hippocampal microglia in mice 
suffering from depression induced by early social isolation (ESI). Results 
showed that 8 days of ESI induced depressive-like behaviors in a tail suspension 
test, forced swim test, sucrose preference test, and open field test, and it 
also induced a loss and dystrophy of hippocampal microglia. We found that this 
ESI-induced loss of hippocampal microglia was mediated by both microglial 
activation and apoptosis. This was demonstrated by the following results: (i) 1 
day of ESI induced an obvious activation of hippocampal microglia followed by 
their apoptosis, and (ii) the blockade of the initial activation of hippocampal 
microglia by minocycline pretreatment suppressed the ESI-induced apoptosis and 
loss as well as ESI-induced depressive-like behavior. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 
and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), two activators of microglia, 
almost completely reversed ESI-induced depressive-like behavior by promoting 
microglial proliferation in the hippocampus. These results reveal an etiological 
role of hippocampal microglial loss in ESI-induced depression and demonstrate 
that the restoration of microglial homeostasis in the hippocampus may serve as a 
therapeutic strategy for depression induced by early-life stress.

The consequences of stress depend on characteristics of the stressor, including 
the duration of exposure, severity, and predictability. Exposure of mice to 
repeated neck restraint has been shown to bidirectionally modulate the potential 
for long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus (DG) in a manner dependent 
on the number of restraint repetitions, but the influence of repeated brief neck 
restraint on electrophysiology of single DG neurons has not yet been 
investigated. Here, we aimed at finding the effects of 1, 3, 7, 14, or 21 daily 
neck restraint sessions lasting 10 min on electrophysiological characteristics 
of DG granule cells as well as excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to 
these neurons. While the excitability of DG granule cells and inhibitory 
synaptic transmission were unchanged, neck restraint decreased the frequency of 
spontaneous excitatory currents after three repetitions but enhanced it after 14 
and 21 repetitions. The consequences of repeated neck restraint on 
hippocampus-dependent memory were investigated using the object location test 
(OLT). Neck restraint stress impaired cognitive performance in the OLT after 
three repetitions but improved it after 14 and 21 repetitions. Mice subjected to 
three neck restraint sessions displayed an increase in the measures of 
depressive and anxiety-like behaviors, however, prolongation of the exposure to 
neck restraint resulted in a gradual decline in the intensity of these measures. 
These data indicate that stress imposed by an increasing number of repeated neck 
restraint episodes bidirectionally modulates both excitatory synaptic 
transmission in the DG and cognitive performance in the object location memory 
task.

Psychological depression is frequently linked to alcohol abuse and even serves 
as key indicators of an alcohol use disorder (AUD). This relationship is 
supported by preclinical findings in which depression-like phenotypes develop in 
animals exposed to chronic intermittent ethanol vapor, a common preclinical 
model of alcohol dependence. However, the emergence of these maladaptive 
phenotypes following repeated binge-like ethanol drinking remains relatively 
unexplored. The purpose of this study was to evaluate depression-like behaviors 
associated with binge-like consumption in mice. Using the drinking-in-the-dark 
(DID) paradigm, we examined the impact of multiple binge-like cycles (1, 3, or 
6) on depression-like behaviors in the forced swim test (FST) and sucrose 
preference as a test for anhedonia. We also assessed the effect of repeated 
binge cycles on the consumption of bitter and sweet tastants over a range of 
concentrations. Results indicated that binge-like ethanol drinking did not lead 
to depression-like behavior as repeated cycles of DID did not alter sucrose 
consumption or preference nor did it impact time spent immobile during the FST. 
Animals that experienced six cycles of DID showed increased quinine consumption 
and increased quinine preference, which may be indicative of an escalated 
preference for tastants that resemble the gustatory aspects of ethanol. 
Interestingly, an unexpected ~20% increase in hypermobility was observed after 
three cycles of binge-like ethanol drinking. Although the FST is most frequently 
used to model depression-like behavior, emerging evidence suggests that 
increased hypermobility during the FST could be indicative of an inability to 
cope in a stressful situation, suggesting that repeated ethanol exposure in the 
present experiment transiently enhances stress reactivity.

Accumulating evidence indicates an interaction between inflammation and 
depression since increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines are associated 
with depression-related symptoms. Melatonin is a hormone synthesized and 
secreted by the pineal gland with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and 
antidepressant-like effects. In this way, it would be interesting to evaluate 
the putative antidepressant-like effect of melatonin treatment in an acute 
inflammation mice model of depression. The present study aimed to investigate 
the effect of melatonin treatment on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced 
depressive-like behavior, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and alteration on 
brain-derived neurotrophic fator (BDNF) levels. Mice were treated with melatonin 
(10 mg/kg, i.p.) 30 min before LPS (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) injection. Twenty-four 
hours after LPS infusion, mice were submitted to the behavioral tests and, 
thereafter, biochemical determinations were performed. Melatonin treatment 
prevented LPS-induced depressive-like behavior in the forced swim and tail 
suspension tests with no alterations in locomotor activity evaluated in the open 
field test. Melatonin attenuated LPS-induced increase in tumor necrosis factor-α 
(TNF-α) and reduction of BDNF levels in the hippocampus. Treatment with 
melatonin also prevented LPS-induced increase in lipid peroxidation and the 
reduction of glutathione levels in the hippocampus. In conclusion, the present 
study suggests that melatonin treatment exerted neuroprotective effects against 
LPS-induced depressive-like behavior which may be related to reduction of TNF-α 
release, oxidative stress and modulation of BDNF expression.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effect induced by musk on 
Alzheimer's disease-such as neurodegenerative changes in mice exposed to chronic 
unpredictable mild stress (CUMS).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty male Swiss albino mice were divided into 4 groups (n 
= 10); control, CUMS, CUMS + fluoxetine, CUMS + musk. At the end of the 
experiment, behavior of the mice was assessed. Serum corticosterone level, 
hippocampal protein level of the glucocorticoid receptors, and brain-derived 
neurotropic factor were also assessed. Hippocampus was histopathologically 
examined.
RESULTS: Musk improved depressive status induced after exposure to CUMS as 
evidenced by the forced swimming and open field tests and improved the 
short-term memory as evidenced by the elevated plus maze test. Musk reduced both 
corticosterone levels and the hippocampal neurodegenerative changes observed 
after exposure to CUMS. These improvements were comparable to those induced by 
fluoxetine.
CONCLUSION: Musk alleviated the memory impairment and neurodegenerative changes 
induced after exposure to the chronic stress.

Neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) integrate 
peripheral signals and coordinate responses that maintain numerous homeostatic 
functions. An excess of glucocorticoids during fetal development results in 
long-lasting consequences tied to disrupted PVN development. The PVN contains a 
distinct neuronal population and a threefold greater vascular density than the 
surrounding brain regions that prepubertally is reduced in offspring exposed to 
excess glucocorticoids in utero. This study expands the examination of 
sex-specific nonneuronal PVN composition by examining astrocytes, astrocytic 
endfeet, and pericytes. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) competency and composition 
were examined along with depressive-like behavior and 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function in male and female mice. For PVN 
vasculature, female offspring of vehicle (veh)-treated mothers had significantly 
more astrocytes and pericytes than male offspring from the same litters. Female 
offspring from dexamethasone (dex)-treated mothers had significantly lower 
levels of astrocytes than female offspring from veh-treated mothers, whereas 
male offspring from dex-treated mothers had greater levels of pericytes compared 
with veh-treated male offspring. Using the tail-suspension test, male and female 
offspring from dex-treated mothers had significantly shorter latencies to 
immobility, indicating an increase in depression-like behavior, and showed 
greater plasma corticosterone after restraint stress, which was significantly 
greater in female offspring from dex-treated mothers even after recovery. 
Therefore, in addition to long-term sex differences in cellular components of 
the BBB in the PVN that were differentially regulated by fetal glucocorticoid 
exposure, there were behavioral differences observed into early adulthood in a 
sex-specific manner.

OBJECTIVES: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe mental illness characterized by 
episodes of mania and depression. Numerous studies have implicated the 
involvement of endogenous cardiac steroids (CS), and their receptor, Na+, K+ 
-ATPase, in BD. The aim of the present study was to examine the role of brain 
oxidative stress in the CS-induced behavioral effects in mice.
METHODS: Amphetamine (AMPH)-induced hyperactivity, assessed in the open-field 
test, served as a model for manic-like behavior in mice. A reduction in brain CS 
was obtained by specific and sensitive anti-ouabain antibodies. The level of 
oxidative stress was tested in the hippocampus and frontal cortex by measuring 
the activity of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) 
and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), as well as the levels of antioxidant 
non-protein thiols (NPSH) and oxidative damage biomarkers thiobarbituric acid 
reactive substances (TBARS) and protein carbonyl (PC).
RESULTS: AMPH administration resulted in a marked hyperactivity and increased 
oxidative stress, as manifested by increased SOD activity, decreased activities 
of CAT and GPx, reduced levels of NPSH and increased levels of TBARS and PC. The 
administration of anti-ouabain antibodies, which reduced the AMPH-induced 
hyperactivity, protected against the concomitant oxidative stress in the brain.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that oxidative stress participates in the 
effects of endogenous CS on manic-like behavior induced by AMPH. These finding 
support the notion that CS and oxidative stress may be associated with the 
pathophysiology of mania and BD.

Our previous study implied the role of central high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) 
in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depressive-like behaviors that could 
partially abrogate by glycyrrhizic acid (GZA). Here, we considered the potential 
mechanism underlying GZA ameliorating chronic stress-induced depression both in 
vivo and in vitro. Depression model was established with the 4-week chronic 
unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mice. Sucrose preference test, tail suspension 
test and open field test were performed to reflect depressive-like behaviors. 
Enzyme activity of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) was recorded with the ratio 
of kynurenine (KYN) / tryptophan (Trp). Transcription of gene was evaluated by 
RT-PCR. Along with depressive-like behaviors, IDO, the rate-limiting enzyme of 
the kynurenine pathway (KP), was upregulated at the level of mRNA expression, 
and enzyme activity was also elevated in stressed hippocampi and 
LPS/HMGB1-treated hippocampus slices. Treatment of mice with GZA, the inhibitor 
of HMGB1, prevented the activated enzymes in KP and the development of 
depressive-like behaviors. These experiments demonstrate that GZA may restrain 
HMGB1 thus improving chronic stress-induced depressive behavior through 
regulating KP.

The circadian clock system is associated with feeding and mood. Patients with 
night eating syndrome (NES) delay their eating rhythm and their mood declines 
during the evening and night, manifesting as time-specific depression. 
Therefore, we hypothesized that the NES feeding pattern might cause 
time-specific depression. We established new NES model by restricted feeding 
with high-fat diet during the inactive period under normal-fat diet ad libitum. 
The FST (forced swimming test) immobility time in the NES model group was 
prolonged only after lights-on, corresponding to evening and early night for 
humans. We examined the effect of the NES feeding pattern on peripheral clocks 
using PER2::LUCIFERASE knock-in mice and an in vivo monitoring system. Caloric 
intake during the inactive period would shift the peripheral clock, and might be 
an important factor in causing the time-specific depression-like behavior. In 
the NES model group, synthesis of serotonin and norepinephrine were increased, 
but utilization and metabolism of these monoamines were decreased under stress. 
Desipramine shortened some mice's FST immobility time in the NES model group. 
The present study suggests that the NES feeding pattern causes phase shift of 
peripheral clocks and malfunction of the monoamine system, which may contribute 
to the development of time-specific depression.

Various growth factors regulate synapse development and neurogenesis, and are 
essential for brain function. Changes in growth factor signaling are implicated 
in many neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, autism and epilepsy. We 
have previously identified that fibroblast growth factor 22 (FGF22) is critical 
for excitatory synapse formation in several brain regions including the 
hippocampus. Mice with a genetic deletion of FGF22 (FGF22 null mice) have fewer 
excitatory synapses in the hippocampus. We have further found that as a 
behavioral consequence, FGF22 null mice show a depression-like behavior 
phenotype such as increased passive stress-coping behavior and anhedonia, 
without any changes in motor, anxiety, or social cognitive tests, suggesting 
that FGF22 is specifically important for affective behavior. Thus, addressing 
the precise roles of FGF22 in the brain will help understand how synaptogenic 
growth factors regulate affective behavior. In the hippocampus, FGF22 is 
expressed mainly by CA3 pyramidal neurons, but also by a subset of dentate 
granule cells. We find that in addition to synapse formation, FGF22 also 
contributes to neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus: FGF22 null mice show decreased 
dentate neurogenesis. To understand the cell type-specific roles of FGF22, we 
generated and analyzed CA3-specific FGF22 knockout mice (FGF22-CA3KO). We show 
that FGF22-CA3KO mice have reduced excitatory synapses on CA3 pyramidal neurons, 
but do not show changes in dentate neurogenesis. Behaviorally, FGF22-CA3KO mice 
still show increased immobility and decreased latency to float in the forced 
swim test and decreased preference for sucrose in the sucrose preference test, 
which are suggestive of a depressive-like phenotype similar to FGF22 null mice. 
These results demonstrate that: (i) CA3-derived FGF22 serves as a target-derived 
excitatory synaptic organizer in CA3 in vivo; (ii) FGF22 plays important roles 
in dentate neurogenesis, but CA3-derived FGF22 is not involved in neurogenesis; 
and (iii) a depression-like phenotype can result from FGF22 inactivation 
selectively in CA3 pyramidal neurons. Our results link the role of CA3-derived 
FGF22 in synapse development, and not in neurogenesis, to affective behavior.

Ketamine is a non-competitive antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors 
(NMDARs). Growing evidence suggests that a single dose of ketamine produces a 
series of rapid and remarkable antidepressant properties. However, the 
mechanisms remain unclear. In our study, the antidepressant properties of a 
single dose of ketamine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) in mice exposed to chronic 
unpredictable stress (CUS) were assessed using the open-field test (OFT) and the 
forced swimming test (FST). Early growth response 1 (Egr-1) and postsynaptic 
density protein 95 (PSD-95) mRNA and protein expression levels were examined 
using qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively. Dendritic spine density in the CA1 
region of the hippocampus was detected by Golgi staining. AMPAR currents in 
hippocampal slices were measured by electrophysiology. Our study showed that CUS 
induced a significant depression-like behavior accompanied by an upregulation of 
Egr-1 and downregulations of PSD-95, spine density, and AMPAR currents in the 
hippocampus, and a single dose of ketamine rapidly restored these changes. 
Interestingly, a single dose of Ro-25-6981 (an GluN2B antagonist, 10 mg/kg, 
i.p.) or Egr-1 siRNA, but not NVP AAM077 (an GluN2A antagonist, 10 mg/kg, i.p.), 
could produce the same antidepressant effects as ketamine. These data 
demonstrate that ketamine may produce its rapid antidepressant effects by 
downregulating the expression of Egr-1 via blocking GluN2B in the hippocampus.

OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to investigate the antidepressant effect of 
the traditional Korean medical pharmacopuncture, Liver Qi Depression (HJ11), in 
a mouse model of depression induced by exposure to chronic immobilization stress 
(CIS).
METHODS: Mice were subjected to 2 hours of immobilization stress daily for 
14 days. They were also injected with distilled water (DW) (CIS + DW) or HJ11 at 
the acupoints HT7, SP6, and GV20 (CIS + HJ11) an hour before stress. The 
positive control group (CIS + paroxetine) was intraperitoneally injected with 
paroxetine (10 mg/kg, 14 days). The tail suspension test and the forced swimming 
test were performed to assess depression-like behaviors. Western blotting was 
also conducted to seek the change in brain.
RESULTS: CIS + DW mice showed significantly longer immobile times in the tail 
suspension test and forced swimming test than sham mice that did not go through 
daily restraint. Immobility of CIS + HJ11 and that of CIS + paroxetine mice was 
significantly decreased compared with immobility of CIS + DW mice. 
Immunoblotting showed that HJ11 increased the expression of brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor both in the hippocampus and the amygdala.
CONCLUSION: HJ11 improves depressive-like behaviors in the stress-induced mouse 
model of depression, and the results indicate that the neuroprotective effect of 
HJ11, identified by brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression, may play a 
critical role in its antidepressant effect.

BACKGROUND: Presence of free radical scavenging activity in Murrayakoenigii, 
commonly known as Curry leaves, has been shown in previous studies. Oxidative 
stress plays an important role in the development of various neurobehavioral 
disorders including anxiety and depression.
AIM: The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of Murraya koenigii in 
animal models of depression and anxiety.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect of incremental doses of Murraya koenigii 
aqueous leaf extract was evaluated on spontaneous motor activity (SMA), open arm 
incursions in elevated plus maze, and despair behaviour in forced swim (FST) and 
tail suspension (TST) tests as compared to control groups in Swiss albino mice.
RESULTS: Murraya koenigii 300 mg/kg, p.o. (MK300) and 400 mg/kg, p.o. (MK400) 
reduced the SMA count from 754 ± 64.9 to 540 ± 29 and 295 ± 34 respectively, 
which was statistically significant. MK300 and MK400 reduced significantly the 
open arm count from 29 ± 8.6 to 16 ± 7 and 10 ± 3.9, respectively. On FST, MK400 
reduced the duration of immobility from 145.5 ± 29 to 91 ± 17.3, which was 
statistically significant. On TST, MK produced a dose-dependent decrease in the 
duration of immobility; however, it was statistically significant only with 
MK400.
CONCLUSION: Murraya koenigii aqueous leaf extract reduced the despair behavior 
in experimental animal models, suggesting an anti-depressant like activity. 
Murraya koenigii extract also reduced spontaneous locomotor activity in a 
dose-dependent manner suggesting a sedative and/or anxiolytic effect though 
there wasn't any anxiolytic effect in the elevated plus maze test.

Camellia euphlebia (family, Theaceae) is a Chinese folk medicine, known for its 
multiple pharmacological properties. The present study aimed to provide further 
insights into the therapeutic basis of C. euphlebia using several animal 
behavioral tests and physiological indexes. Tail suspension test, forced 
swimming test, open-field test, chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), 
reversal of reserpine-induced hypothermia and palpebral ptosis, and 
5-hydroxytryptophane-induced head-twitch response were used to evaluate the 
antidepressant effect of aqueous extract of Camellia euphlebia (AEC) on mice. 
The possible underlying mechanism was explored by investigating the changes 
associated with several parameters of animal behavior, as well as the changes in 
monoamine neurotransmitter and stress hormone levels in these animals during the 
tests. Mice administered AEC at 100 and 200 mg/kg/day doses for 7 days showed 
significantly reduced immobility duration in forced swimming test and tail 
suspension test, whilst exhibiting no apparent changes in locomotor activity. 
Additionally, administration of AEC also effectively antagonized 
reserpine-induced palpebral ptosis and hypothermia and enhanced 
5-hydroxytryptophane-induced head-twitch response. AEC significantly elevated 
the levels of serotonin, noradrenaline and dopamine in the blood and brain 
compared to non-treated mice. After 28 days of administration, the maximum AEC 
dose (100 mg/kg/day) significantly reversed CUMS-induced inhibition of weight 
gain and sucrose intake, while decreasing the levels of plasma 
adrenocorticotropic hormone and serum corticosterone. The antidepressant effect 
of AEC appeared to involve the alteration of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis 
and monoaminergic systems.

Silymarin, a plant-derived polyphenolic flavonoid of Silybum marianum, elicited 
significant antidepressant-like activity in an acute restraint stress model of 
depression. It improved monoamines, mainly 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels in 
the cortex, dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) in the cerebellum in mice. The 
present study was undertaken to explore the antidepressant potential of 
silymarin in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) induced depressive-like 
behavior in mice, and to find out its probable mechanism(s) of action, mainly 
neurogenesis, neuroinflammation, and/or oxidative stress. The mice were 
subjected to CUMS for 28 days (4 weeks) and administered with silymarin (100 
mg/kg and 200 mg/kg), or fluoxetine or vehicle from days 8 to 28 (3 weeks 
simultaneously). Animals were evaluated for behavioral changes, such as 
anhedonia by sucrose preference test, behavioral despair by forced swim test, 
and exploratory behaviors by an open field test. In addition, neurobiochemical 
alterations, mainly monoamines, 5-HT, NE, DA, neurotrophic factor BDNF, and 
cytokines, IL-6, TNF-α, oxidant-antioxidant parameters by determining the 
malondialdehyde formation (an index of lipid peroxidation process), superoxide 
dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity in hippocampus and cerebral cortex 
along with serum corticosterone were investigated. Our findings reveal that mice 
subjected to CUMS exhibited lower sucrose preference, increase immobility time 
without affecting general locomotion of the animals, and reduce BDNF, 5-HT, NE, 
and DA level, increased serum corticosterone, IL-6 and TNF-α along with an 
oxidant-antioxidant imbalance in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Silymarin 
significantly reversed the CUMS-induced changes in the hippocampus and cerebral 
cortex in mice. Thus, the possible mechanism involved in the antidepressant-like 
activity of silymarin is correlated to the alleviation of monoaminergic, 
neurogenesis (enhancing 5-HT, NE, and BDNF levels), and attenuation of 
inflammatory cytokines system and oxidative stress by modulation of 
corticosterone response, restoration of antioxidant defense system in cerebral 
cortex and hippocampus.

Our previous study has reported that the proactive secretion and role of central 
high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) in lipopolysaccharide-induced depressive 
behavior. Here, the potential mechanism of HMGB1 mediating 
chronic-stress-induced depression through the kynurenine pathway (KP) was 
further explored both in vivo and in vitro. Depression model was established 
with the 4-week chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Sucrose preference and 
Barnes maze test were performed to reflect depressive behaviors. The ratio of 
kynurenine (KYN)/tryptophan (Trp) represented the enzyme activity of 
indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). Gene transcription and protein expression 
were assayed by real-time RT-PCR and western-blot or ELISA kit respectively. 
Along with depressive behaviors, HMGB1 concentrations in the hippocampus and 
serum substantially increased post 4-week CUMS exposure. Concurrent with the 
upregulated HMGB1 protein, the regulator of translocation of HMGB1, sirtuin 1 
(SIRT1) concentration in the hippocampus remarkably increased. In addition to 
HMGB1 and SIRT1, IDO, the rate limiting enzyme of KP, was upregulated at the 
level of mRNA expression and enzyme activity in stressed hippocampi and 
LPS/HMGB1-treated hippocampal slices. The gene transcription of kynurenine 
monooxygenase (KMO) and kynureninase (KYNU) in the downstream of KP also 
increased both in vivo and in vitro. Mice treated with ethyl pyruvate (EP), the 
inhibitor of HMGB1 releasing, were observed with lower tendency of developing 
depressive behaviors and reduced activation of enzymes in KP. All of these 
experiments demonstrate that the role of HMGB1 on the induction of depressive 
behavior is mediated by KP activation.

In view of anxiolytic, antidepressant and memory strengthen properties of Allium 
cepa (AC; onion) bulb in various investigations; we aimed to evaluate the useful 
effects of onion on single immobilization stress -induced biochemical and 
behavioral changes. Mice in test group were treated with AC powder 
(200 mg/kg/day), dissolved in water, while the control group were received 
drinking water for 14 days. After 14 days control and AC treated mice were 
further divided into unstressed and stressed groups. Animals in the stressed 
group were subjected to immobilization stress for 2 h. 24-h after the 
immobilization stress, behavioral activities were monitored. Immobilization 
stress-induced an anxiogenic behavior in mice subjected to elevated plus maze 
test (EPM) and light dark activity test (LDA). 2-h immobilization stress-induced 
depressive behavior in animals measured by forced swim test (FST). 
Administration of AC attenuated the immobilization stress-induced behavioral 
deficits. Highest memory performance was observed in stressed mice that were 
pre-treated with AC in Morris water maze (MWM). Brain lipid peroxidation, 
antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, GPx) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities 
were also estimated. Present study suggests a role of antioxidant enzymes in the 
attenuation of 2-h stress induced anxiety and depression, and enhanced cognitive 
function as well by AC. The findings therefore suggest that supplementation of 
AC may be beneficial in the treatment of anxiety, depression and enhancement of 
memory function.

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a critical effector of 
depression-like behaviors and antidepressant responses. Here, we show that VGF 
(non-acronymic), which is robustly regulated by BDNF/TrkB signaling, is 
downregulated in hippocampus (male/female) and upregulated in nucleus accumbens 
(NAc) (male) in depressed human subjects and in mice subjected to chronic social 
defeat stress (CSDS). Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-Cre-mediated Vgf ablation in 
floxed VGF mice, in dorsal hippocampus (dHc) or NAc, led to pro-depressant or 
antidepressant behaviors, respectively, while dHc- or NAc-AAV-VGF overexpression 
induced opposite outcomes. Mice with reduced VGF levels in the germ line 
(Vgf+/-) or in dHc (AAV-Cre-injected floxed mice) showed increased 
susceptibility to CSDS and impaired responses to ketamine treatment in the 
forced swim test. Floxed mice with conditional pan-neuronal (Synapsin-Cre) but 
not those with forebrain (αCaMKII-Cre) Vgf ablation displayed increased 
susceptibility to subthreshold social defeat stress, suggesting that neuronal 
VGF, expressed in part in inhibitory interneurons, regulates depression-like 
behavior. Acute antibody-mediated sequestration of VGF-derived C-terminal 
peptides AQEE-30 and TLQP-62 in dHc induced pro-depressant effects. Conversely, 
dHc TLQP-62 infusion had rapid antidepressant efficacy, which was reduced in 
BDNF floxed mice injected in dHc with AAV-Cre, and in NBQX- and 
rapamycin-pretreated wild-type mice, these compounds blocking 
α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor and 
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, respectively. VGF is therefore a 
critical modulator of depression-like behaviors in dHc and NAc. In hippocampus, 
the antidepressant response to ketamine is associated with rapid VGF 
translation, is impaired by reduced VGF expression, and as previously reported, 
requires coincident, rapid BDNF translation and release.

Ghrelin is a 28-amino acid polypeptide that regulates feeding, glucose 
metabolism, and emotionality (stress, anxiety, and depression). Plasma ghrelin 
circulates as desacyl ghrelin (DAG) or, in an acylated form, acyl ghrelin (AG), 
through the actions of ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT), exhibiting low or high 
affinity, respectively, for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) 1a. 
We investigated the role of endogenous AG, DAG, and GHSR1a signaling on anxiety 
and stress responses using ghrelin knockout (Ghr KO), GOAT KO, and Ghsr 
stop-floxed (Ghsr null) mice. Behavioral and hormonal responses were tested in 
the elevated plus maze and light/dark (LD) box. Mice lacking both AG and DAG 
(Ghr KO) increased anxiety-like behaviors across tests, whereas anxiety 
reactions were attenuated in DAG-treated Ghr KO mice and in mice lacking AG 
(GOAT KO). Notably, loss of GHSR1a (Ghsr null) did not affect anxiety-like 
behavior in any test. Administration of AG and DAG to Ghr KO mice with lifelong 
ghrelin deficiency reduced anxiety-like behavior and decreased 
phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation in the 
Edinger-Westphal nucleus in wild-type mice, a site normally expressing GHSR1a 
and involved in stress- and anxiety-related behavior. Collectively, our data 
demonstrate distinct roles for endogenous AG and DAG in regulation of anxiety 
responses and suggest that the behavioral impact of ghrelin may be context 
dependent.

Depression is a debilitating psychiatric disorder with a huge socioeconomic 
burden, and its treatment relies on antidepressants including selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Recently, the melatonergic system that is 
closely associated with the serotonergic system has been implicated in the 
pathophysiology and treatment of depression. However, it remains unknown whether 
combined treatment with SSRI and melatonin has synergistic antidepressant 
effects. In this study, we applied a sub-chronic restraint stress paradigm, and 
evaluated the potential antidepressant effects of combined fluoxetine and 
melatonin in adult male mice. Sub-chronic restraint stress (6 h/day for 10 days) 
induced depression-like behavior as shown by deteriorated fur state, increased 
latency to groom in the splash test, and increased immobility time in the 
forced-swim test. Repeated administration of either fluoxetine or melatonin at 
10 mg/kg during stress exposure failed to prevent depression-like phenotypes. 
However, combined treatment with fluoxetine and melatonin at the selected dose 
attenuated stress-induced behavioral abnormalities. Moreover, we found that the 
antidepressant effects of combined treatment were associated with the 
normalization of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-tropomyosin receptor 
kinase B (TrkB) signaling in the hippocampus, but not in the prefrontal cortex. 
Our findings suggest that combined fluoxetine and melatonin treatment exerts 
synergistic antidepressant effects possibly by restoring hippocampal BDNF-TrkB 
signaling.

Major depression is a common mental disorder that has been established to be 
associated with a decrease in serotonin and/or serotonin transporters in the 
brain. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ) has been introduced 
as a potential target for depression treatment. Telmisartan was recently shown 
to activate PPARδ expression; therefore, the effectiveness of telmisartan in 
treating depression was investigated. In unpredictable chronic mild stress 
(UCMS) model, treatment with telmisartan for five weeks notably decrease in the 
time spent in the central and the reduced frequency of grooming and rearing in 
open filed test (OFT) and the decreased sucrose consumption in sucrose 
preference test (SPT) compared with the paradigms. Telmisartan also reversed the 
decrease in PPARδ and 5-HTT levels in the hippocampus of depression-like mice. 
Administration of PPARδ antagonist GSK0660 and direct infusion of sh-PPARδ into 
the brain blocked the effects of telmisartan on the improvement of 
depression-like behavior in these mice. Moreover, telmisartan enhanced the 
expression of PPARδ and 5HTT in H19-7 cells. In conclusion, the obtained results 
suggest that telmisartan improves symptoms of stress-induced depression in 
animals under chronic stress through activation of PPARδ. Therefore, telmisartan 
may be developed as a potential anti-depressant in the future.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of major depression in those with HIV/AIDS is 
substantially higher than in the general population. Mechanisms underlying this 
comorbidity are poorly understood. HIV-transactivator of transcription (Tat) 
protein, produced and excreted by HIV, could be involved. We determined whether 
conditional Tat protein expression in mice is sufficient to induce 
depression-like behaviors and oxidative stress. Further, as oxidative stress is 
associated with depression, we determined whether decreasing or increasing 
oxidative stress by administering methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) or diethylmaleate 
(DEM), respectively, altered depression-like behavior.
METHODS: GT-tg bigenic mice received intraperitoneal saline or doxycycline (Dox, 
25-100 mg/kg/day) to induce Tat expression. G-tg mice, which do not express Tat 
protein, also received Dox. Depression-like behavior was assessed with the tail 
suspension test (TST) and the two-bottle saccharin/water consumption task. 
Reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) were assessed ex vivo. Medial frontal 
cortex (MFC) oxidative stress and temperature were measured in vivo with 
9.4-Tesla proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).
RESULTS: Tat expression increased TST immobility time in an exposure-dependent 
manner and reduced saccharin consumption. MSM decreased immobility time while 
DEM increased it in saline-treated GT-tg mice. Tat and MSM behavioral effects 
persisted for 28 days. Tat and DEM increased while MSM decreased ROS/RNS levels. 
Tat expression increased MFC glutathione levels and temperature.
CONCLUSIONS: Tat expression induced rapid and enduring depression-like behaviors 
and oxidative stress. Increasing/decreasing oxidative stress 
increased/decreased, respectively, depression-like behavior. Thus, Tat produced 
by HIV may contribute to the high depression prevalence among those with HIV. 
Further, mitigation of oxidative stress could reduce depression severity.

Growing evidence suggests that inflammatory processes may be involved in 
depressive disorders. Inflammation is known to induce mitochondrial dysfunction 
in the nervous system. However, whether mitochondrial dysfunction is involved in 
the occurrence of inflammation-induced depressive-like behavior remains to be 
investigated. The present study aims to firstly, clarify whether mitochondrial 
dysfunction contributes to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depression-like 
behavior in mice and secondly, determine whether the anti-oxidant resveratrol 
alleviates inflammation-induced depressive-like behavior through the prevention 
of mitochondrial dysfunction in the hippocampus. We found that the 
administration of LPS led to mitochondrial oxidative stress and dysfunction as 
evidenced by increased mitochondrial superoxide production and decreased 
mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production in the hippocampus. These 
effects were attenuated by intracerebroventricular (ICV) Injection of the 
mitochondria-targeted antioxidant Mito-TEMPO. LPS-treated mice displayed 
depressive-like behaviors as evidenced by reduced sucrose preference, increased 
immobility time and decreased struggling time in the forced swimming test. Both 
Mito-TEMPO and resveratrol could significantly improve the LPS-induced 
depressive-like behaviors. In contrast, ICV Injection of rotenone, the 
mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitor, induced mitochondrial oxidative 
stress and dysfunction in the hippocampus, and resulted in depressive-like 
behaviors. Moreover, resveratrol alleviated the LPS-induced apoptosis of 
hippocampal cells. The antidepressant action of resveratrol was accomplished 
through the interruption of mitochondrial oxidative stress and the prevention of 
cell apoptosis in the hippocampus. These findings support the potential for 
resveratrol as a possible pharmacological agent for depression treatment in the 
future.

Chronic stress is associated with impaired neurogenesis, neurodegeneration and 
behavioral dysfunction, whereas the mechanism underlying stress-mediated 
neurological complications is still not clear. In the present study, we aimed to 
investigate whether chronic unpredicted stress (CUS) mediated neurological 
alterations are associated with impaired hippocampal insulin signaling or not, 
and studied the effect of quercetin in this scenario. Male Swiss albino mice 
were subjected to 21day CUS, during which 30mg/kg quercetin treatment was given 
orally. After 21days, behavioral functions were evaluated in terms of locomotor 
activity (Actophotometer), muscle coordination (Rota-rod), depression (Tail 
Suspension Test (TST), Forced Swim Test (FST)) and memory performance 
(Passive-avoidance step-down task (PASD)). Further, hippocampal insulin 
signaling was evaluated in terms of protein expression of insulin, insulin 
receptor (IR) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT-4) and neurogenesis was evaluated 
in terms of doublecortin (DCX) expression. 21day CUS significantly impaired 
locomotion and had no effect on muscle coordination. Stressed animals were 
depressed and showed markedly impaired memory functions. Quercetin treatment 
significantly improvement stress-mediated behavior dysfunction as indicated by 
improved locomotion, lesser immobility time and greater frequency of upward 
turning in TST and FST and increased transfer latency on the day 2 (short-term 
memory) and day 5 (long-term memory) in PASD test. We observed significantly 
higher IR expression and significantly lower GLUT-4 expression in the 
hippocampus of stressed animals, despite of nonsignificant difference in insulin 
levels. Further, chronic stress impaired hippocampal neurogenesis, as indicated 
by the significantly reduced levels of hippocampal DCX expression. Quercetin 
treatment significantly lowered insulin and IR expression and significantly 
enhanced GLUT-4 and DCX expression in the hippocampus, when compared to CUS. In 
conclusion, quercetin treatment efficiently alleviated stress mediated 
behavioral dysfunction by modulating hippocampal insulin signaling and 
neurogenesis.

The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism has been associated with sensitivity to stress 
and affective disorders. We therefore sought to model the inter-causality of 
these relationships under controlled laboratory conditions. We subjected 
humanized BDNF Val66Met (hBDNFVal66Met) transgenic mice to a history of stress, 
modeled by chronic late-adolescent corticosterone (CORT) exposure, before 
evaluating affective-related behavior using the forced-swim test (FST) in 
adulthood. While hBDNFMet/Met mice had a depression-like phenotype in the FST 
irrespective of CORT, hBDNFVal/Val wildtype mice had a resilient phenotype but 
developed an equally robust depressive-like phenotype following CORT. A range of 
stress-sensitive molecules were studied across the corticohippocampal axis, and 
where genotype differences occurred following CORT they tended to inversely 
coincide with the behavior of the hBDNFVal/Val group. Notably, tyrosine 
hydroxylase was markedly down-regulated in the mPFC of hBDNFVal/Val mice as a 
result of CORT treatment, which mimicked expression levels of hBDNFMet/Met mice 
and the FST behavior of both groups. The expression of calretinin, PSD-95, and 
truncated TrkB were also concomitantly reduced in the mPFC of hBDNFVal/Val mice 
by CORT. This work establishes BDNFVal66Met genotype as a regulator of 
behavioral despair, and identifies new biological targets of BDNF genetic 
variation relevant to stress-inducible disorders such as depression.

Major depression is hypothesized to be associated with dysregulations of the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and impairments in adult hippocampal 
neurogenesis. Adult-born hippocampal neurons are required for several effects of 
antidepressants and increasing the rate of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) 
before exposure to chronic corticosterone is sufficient to protect against its 
harmful effects on behavior. However, it is an open question if increasing AHN 
after the onset of chronic stress exposure would be able to rescue behavioral 
deficits and which mechanisms might be involved in recovery. We investigated 
this question by using a 10-week unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) model 
on a transgenic mouse line (iBax mice), in which the pro-apoptotic gene Bax can 
be inducibly ablated in neural stem cells following Tamoxifen injection, 
therefore enhancing the survival of newborn neurons in the adult brain. We did 
not observe any effect of our treatment in non-stress conditions, but we did 
find that increasing AHN after 2 weeks of UCMS is sufficient to counteract the 
effects of UCMS on certain behaviors (splash test and changes in coat state) and 
endocrine levels and thus to display some antidepressant-like effects. We 
observed that increasing AHN lowered the elevated basal corticosterone levels in 
mice exposed to UCMS. This was accompanied by a tamoxifen-induced reversal of 
the lack of stress-induced decrease in neuronal activation in the anteromedial 
division of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTMA) after 
intrahippocampal dexamethasone infusion, pointing to a possible mechanism 
through which adult-born neurons might have exerted their effects. Our results 
contribute to the neurogenesis hypothesis of depression by suggesting that 
increasing AHN may be beneficial not just before, but also after exposure to 
stress by counteracting several of its effects, in part through regulating the 
HPA axis.

BACKGROUND: Stress is a prevailing risk factor for mood-related illnesses, 
wherein women represent the majority of those affected by major depression. 
Despite the growing literature suggesting that affective disorders can arise 
after a traumatic event is vicariously experienced, this relationship remains 
understudied in female subjects at the preclinical level. Thus, the objective of 
the current investigation was to examine whether exposure to emotional and/or 
psychological stress (ES) mediates depression-related outcomes in female mice.
METHODS: Female C57BL/6 mice (8 weeks old, null parity) vicariously experienced 
the defeat bout of a male conspecific, by a male CD1 aggressor, for 10 
consecutive days. Twenty-four hours after the last stress exposure, female mice 
were tested in the social interaction, sucrose preference, tail suspension, or 
elevated plus maze tests. Furthermore, we examined whether ketamine and 
chlordiazepoxide, pharmacological agents used to treat mood-related disorders in 
the clinical population, would reverse the ES-induced social dysfunction.
RESULTS: When compared with control mice, female mice exposed to ES displayed 
decreased social behavior and preference for sucrose, along with increased 
immobility in the tail suspension test. Also, they displayed higher levels of 
blood serum corticosterone, as well as decreased body weight. Lastly, the 
ES-induced avoidance-like phenotype was ameliorated by both ketamine and 
chlordiazepoxide.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that female mice exposed to ES display a 
behavioral and physiologic profile that mimics symptoms of depression in the 
clinical population. As such, this experimental model may be adopted to examine 
vicarious stress-induced mood-related disorders, as well as pharmacological 
antidepressant response, in a sex-specific manner.

The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) is a key site for 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) 
synthesis and release. DRN dysfunction has been implicated in several 
stress-related disorders, including depression and anxiety. The lateral 
habenular nucleus (LHb) has been shown to inhibit the activity of DRN 5-HT 
neurons, and thus the LHb-DRN pathway plays an important role in the 
pathogenesis of depression. Although it is known that the LHb also receives the 
projection from the 5-HT neuron in the DRN, whether 5-HT neurons in the DRN can 
influence activity of the LHb in vivo and whether this effect is related to the 
induced behavioral changes have not been investigated. In the current study, we 
determined how injecting γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) into the DRN to inhibit 5-HT 
neurons affected behavior and the changes in the activity of LHb neurons in 
mice. We found that GABA injection into the DRN induced depression-like behavior 
in mice, as indicated by increased immobility time, and decreased climbing time 
in the forced swimming test and the tail suspension test, decreased time spent 
in the center and total distance moved in the open field test. Using 
extracellular single unit recording, we showed that the firing rate of LHb 
neurons decreased after GABA microinjection into the DRN. Further, c-Fos 
expression in LHb neurons was inhibited. Together our results indicate that 
inhibition of DRN 5-HT neurons can cause decreased LHb activity and 
depression-like behavior in mice, however this depression-like behavior could be 
independent of the LHb activity. The observed decrease in LHb activity is 
probably due to the presence of a negative feedback loop between the DRN and the 
LHb, which may play a role in maintaining emotional homeostasis.

Jieyu chufan (JYCF) is a well-known Chinese traditional medicine used for 
depression; however, the molecular mechanism underlying its anti-depressant 
action has remained elusive. In the present study, the anti-depressant effects 
of JYCF and the potential mechanisms were investigated in a mouse model. Five 
groups of 12 C57BL/6 mice each were used in the study, including a normal 
control group (NC group), a model control group (MC group) and three groups, 
which received different doses of JYCF (1.25, 2.5 and 5 g/kg) orally for 21 days 
(JYCF groups). The MC group and the three JYCF groups were subjected to 3 weeks 
of unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) to induce depression-like behavior. 
All groups were subjected to a sucrose consumption test along with a forced 
swimming test to confirm depression-like behavior, an open-field test and an 
elevated plus maze test to confirm anxiety-like behavior, and a Morris water 
maze test to evaluate spatial learning and memory. In addition, synaptic density 
in the hippocampus was evaluated and western blot and immunostaining were used 
to analyze hippocampal expression of postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD95), 
synaptophysin (Syn), cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding 
protein (CREB), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), Akt and glycogen 
synthase kinase (GSK)-3β as well as their phosphorylated (p) versions. The 
results showed that JYCF (2.5 and 5 g/kg) alleviated depressive-like behaviors 
and increased synaptic density in UCMS mice. Moreover, JYCF upregulated the 
expression of PSD95, Syn and BDNF and increased phosphorylated Akt, CREB and 
GSK-3β in the hippocampus. These results suggested that JYCF exerts an 
anti-depressant-like activity in UCMS-induced mice, which is likely to be 
mediated by reversing the stress-induced disruption of BDNF and GSK-3β activity.

BACKGROUND: Catha edulis Forsk. (Khat) is traditionally used for treating 
various disorders. Nevertheless there are no reports of any scientific 
assessment of its psychopharmacological properties.
OBJECTIVE: Therefore, the current study was designed to evaluate the 
antidepressant-like activity of Khat ethanolic extract using established animal 
models of depression and stress.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety healthy male albino mice were used in this study. 
Forced swim, tail suspension and head poking tests were utilized to evaluate the 
antidepressant-like activity of the ethanolic extract of Khat (100, 200 and 400 
mg/kg, i.p.) and escitalopram (standard drug) which were administered 30 min 
prior to the tests. Phytochemical analysis of the standardized extract was 
conducted using liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS).
RESULTS: A significant decrease in the head-dipping behavior was noticed after 
administration of 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg of Khat extract. Moreover, the extract 
significantly decreased the immobility time in tail suspension and forced swim 
tests. The presence of cathinone and cathine were detected in the extract using 
LC-MS.
CONCLUSION: The current results suggest that the extract of Khat leaves has 
acute antidepressant properties and may have sedative effects.
SUMMARY: Antidepressant-like activity of Khat established in vivoThe extract

Genetically altered mice are available on different background strains. While 
respective backcrosses are often performed for pragmatic reasons, e.g. 
references, comparability, or existing protocols, the interaction between the 
mutations per se and the background strain often remains a neglected factor. The 
heterozygous mutation of the glucocorticoid receptor gene (GR) represents a 
well-examined model for depressive-like behavior in mice. To address the 
question in how far a robust depressive-like phenotype on a distinct background 
strain may allow a generalized conclusion, we analyzed respective phenotypes in 
two commonly used inbred strains: i.) C57BL/6N and ii.) BALB/c. Beside the use 
of different genetic models, we also extended our approach by applying two 
alternative paradigms to induce a depressive-like phenotype. Our study therefore 
comprised the model of 'unpredictable chronic mild stress' (UCMS) for four weeks 
and 'learned helplessness' (LH), which were used to study the role of GR, a key 
player in the development of depression. In the course of the experiment two 
cohorts of male GR+/- mice on either C57BL/6N or BALB/c background strain 
underwent a behavioral test battery to assess basal and depressive-like 
features. While both stress paradigms were functional in inducing 
depressive-like changes, the results were strictly strain-dependent. The genetic 
consequences became even more obvious under non-stress conditions with 
significant effects detected in BALB/c mice, which indicates a different basal 
stress predisposition due to differences in the genetic background.

The current study aimed to prove the antidepressant-like effects and the 
probable mechanisms of Schisandrin on depression, which induced by chronic 
unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) in mice. Four weeks of CUMS exposure resulted 
in depressive-like behavior, as indicated by the significant decrease in sucrose 
consumption and increase the immobility time in the forced swim test, but 
without any influence on the locomotor activity. Further, there were significant 
downregulations of GDNF/ERK1/2/ROS and PI3K/AKT/NOX signaling pathways in the 
hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in depressed mice. Treatment of mice with 
Schisandrin (30mg/kg) and Fluoxetine (10mg/kg) significantly ameliorated all the 
behavioral and biochemical changes induced by CUMS. These results suggest that 
Schisandrin produces an antidepressant-like effect in CUMS-induced mice, which 
possibly mediated, at least in part, by rectifying the signaling pathways of 
GDNF/ERK1/2/ROS and PI3K/AKT/NOX.

Preliminary studies conducted in our laboratory have confirmed that Bacopaside I 
(BS-I), a saponin compound isolated from Bacopa monnieri, displayed 
antidepressant-like activity in the mouse behavioral despair model. The present 
investigation aimed to verify the antidepressant-like action of BS-I using a 
mouse model of behavioral deficits induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress 
(CUMS) and further probe its underlying mechanism of action. Mice were exposed 
to CUMS for a period of 5 consecutive weeks to induce depression-like behavior. 
Then, oral gavage administrations with vehicle (model group), fluoxetine 
(12 mg/kg, positive group) or BS-I (5, 15, 45 mg/kg, treated group) once daily 
were started during the last two weeks of CUMS procedure. The results showed 
that BS-I significantly ameliorated CUMS-induced depression-like behaviors in 
mice, as characterized by an elevated sucrose consumption in the sucrose 
preference test and reduced immobility time without affecting spontaneous 
locomotor activity in the forced swimming test, tail suspension test and open 
field test. It was also found that BS-I treatment reversed the increased level 
of plasma corticosterone and decreased mRNA and protein expressions of 
glucocorticoid receptor induced by CUMS exposure, indicating that 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyperactivity of CUMS-exposed mice was 
restored by BS-I treatment. Furthermore, chronic administration of BS-I elevated 
expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (mRNA and protein) 
and activated the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and 
cAMP response element-binding protein in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex 
in mice subjected to CUMS procedure. Taken together, these results indicated 
that BS-I exhibited an obvious antidepressant-like effect in mouse model of 
CUMS-induced depression that was mediated, at least in part, by modulating HPA 
hyperactivity and activating BDNF signaling pathway.

Corticosterone (CORT) treatment has been evidenced to develop a depression-like 
state in animals, that mimic hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis 
dysregulation implicated in the development of depression. The present study 
aimed to examine the ferulic acid (FA), a natural phenolic compound, 
antidepressant and antioxidant activities on the CORT chronic model. Mice orally 
treated with 20mg/kg of CORT for 21days were connsidered control group, while 
mice treated with FA (1mg/kg) or fluoxetine (10mg/kg) for the last week of CORT 
treatment, as drug groups. Three weeks of CORT treatment resulted in 
depressive-like behavior, as indicated by the increase on the immobility time in 
the tail suspension test, grooming in the splash test and an increase in the 
oxidative stress markers in the brain. It was observed that FA ameliorated the 
behavioral and oxidative stress alterations induced by CORT, which may plausibly 
suggest a mode of action for the FA antidepressant effect. The involvement of FA 
repairing the stress caused by HPA-axis dysfunction evidenced that this phenolic 
acid could be further investigated as a novel potential agent to improve the 
management of depression.

The present study was aimed to investigate the anti-stress and memory enhancing 
effects of banana (Musa sapientum L.) fruit pulp and peel extract in male mice. 
Locally bred albino Wistar mice were divided into control and 2 test groups 
(n=10). Control rats received drinking water while test groups were treated with 
banana fruit pulp (600 mg/kg; oral administration) and extract of banana peel 
(400mg/kg; oral administration). Behavioral activities of animals were monitored 
14 days post administration of banana pulp and peel extract. Depression-like 
symptoms were measured by forced swimming test (FST). Anxiety like behavior was 
monitored using light-dark activity (LDA) test and plus maze activity (PMA) test 
and memory functions of rats were assessed by morris water maze (MWM) test. 
Following 2 weeks animals were decapitated and brain was removed for estimation 
of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase (CAT), super oxide dismutase (SOD) and 
reduced glutathione (GSH). In the present study both banana peel and pulp 
increased the time spent in light box and open arm, suggesting anxiolytic 
effects. A significant decrease in immobility time was observed in FST in both 
banana pulp and peel treated animals suggesting antidepressant like effects. 
Moreover, learning and memory assessed by MWM showed decrease in time to reach 
platform in both short term and long term memory test suggested increased memory 
function in both banana pulp and peel treated animals as compared to control 
animals. The activities of all antioxidant enzymes were significantly (p<0.05) 
greater in banana pulp and peel treated animals than control. It is concluded 
that both banana pulp and peel have anti-anxiety, antidepressant effect as well 
as strengthen the memory possibly via its antioxidant mechanism. Therefore, it 
is recommended that supplementation of banana could be taken a vital role in 
stress (anxiety and depression) relief and increased in memory function possibly 
by phyto-antioxidants.

BACKGROUND: Xiao Yao San (XYS) is an herbal prescription which is used in the 
treatment of depression for thousands of years from Song dynasty in China 
(960-1127 A.D.), and is the bestselling and most popular herb formula for 
treating major depression. This study aimed to assess the chronic antidepressant 
effects of XYS and fluoxetine in depressed mice induced by chronic unpredictable 
mild stress (CUMS) and its association with  alterations in glutamate/glutamine 
cycle and glutamate transporters.
METHODS: Mice in the control and model group were given 0.5 ml physiological 
saline by intragastric administration. Mice in two treatment groups were given 
XYS (0.25 g/kg/d) and fluoxetine (2.6 mg/kg/d), respectively. The 
depressive-like behaviors such as forced swim test (FST), sucrose preference 
test (SPT) and novelty-suppressed feeding (NSF) test were measured after mice 
exposed to CUMS for 21 days. Body weight, contents of glutamate and glutamine, 
glutamine/glutamate ratio that is usually thought to reflect glutamate/glutamine 
cycle, and the protein and mRNA expressions of glutamate transporters 
(excitatory amino acid transporter 1-2,GLAST/EAAT1 and GLT-1/EAAT2) were 
measured. The immunoreactivities of GLAST and GLT-1 in the hippocampus were also 
investigated.
RESULTS: After CUMS exposure, mice exhibited depressive-like behaviors, body 
weight loss, increased glutamate level, decreased glutamine level, elevated 
glutamine/glutamate ratio, decreased GLT-1 protein expression and mRNA level, 
and decreased average optical density (AOD) of GLT-1 in the CA1, CA3 and DG in 
the hippocampus. These abnormalities could be effectively reversed by XYS or 
fluoxetine treatment. In addition, the study also found that GLAST expression in 
the hippocampus could not be altered by 21-d CUMS.
CONCLUSION: The studies indicated that XYS may have therapeutic actions on 
depression -like behavior s induced by CUMS in mice possibly mediated by 
modulation of glutamate/glutamine cycle and glutamate transporter GLT-1 in the 
hippocampus.

Neuropeptide VGF C-Terminal Peptide TLQP-62 Alleviates 
Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Memory Deficits and Anxiety-like and Depression-like 
Behaviors in Mice: The Role of BDNF/TrkB Signaling.

Peripheral inflammatory responses affect central nervous system (CNS) function, 
manifesting in symptoms of memory deficits, depression, and anxiety. Previous 
studies have revealed that neuropeptide VGF (nonacronymic) C-terminal peptide 
TLQP-62 rapidly reinforces brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/tropomyosin 
receptor kinase B (TrkB) signaling, regulating memory consolidation and 
antidepressant-like action. However, whether it is beneficial for 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuropsychiatric dysfunction in mice is 
unknown. Herein, we explored the involvement of BDNF/TrkB signaling and 
biochemical alterations in inflammatory or oxidative stress markers in the 
alleviating effects of TLQP-62 on LPS-induced neuropsychiatric dysfunction. The 
mice were treated with TLQP-62 (2 μg/side) via intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) 
injection 1 h before LPS (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) administration. Our results showed 
that a single treatment with LPS (0.5 mg/kg, i.p) is sufficient to produce 
recognition memory deficits (in the novel object recognition test), 
depression-like behavior (in the forced swim test and sucrose preference test), 
and anxiety-like behavior (in the elevated zero maze). However, pretreatment 
with TLQP-62 prevented LPS-induced behavioral dysfunction, neuroinflammatory, 
and oxidative responses. In addition, our results further demonstrated that a 
reduction in BDNF expression mediated by BDNF-shRNA lentivirus significantly 
blocked the effects of TLQP-62, suggesting the critical role of BDNF/TrkB 
signaling in the neuroprotective effects of TLQP-62 in the mice. In conclusion, 
TLQP-62 could be a therapeutic approach for neuropsychiatric disorders, which 
are closely associated with neuroinflammation and oxidative stress.

Epilepsy is fourth most common neurological disorders associated with depression 
and cognitive deficits. As per present scenario, none of the antiseizure drugs 
have been reported successful to have ameliorative effect on epilepsy associated 
depression and cognitive deficits. Thus, the study was envisioned to assess an 
ameliorative potential of agmatine on epilepsy and its efficacy and safety for 
management of associated depression and cognitive deficits. The animals were 
made epileptic employing pentylenetetrazole (35mg/kg i.p. every 48±2h) kindling 
model of epilepsy and subsequently were treated with vehicle, valproic acid 
(300mg/kg/day i.p.) and agmatine (2.5, 5, and 10mg/kg)/day/i.p. for 15days. 
Except naïve, all the groups were challenged with same pentylenetetrazole dose 
as employed during kindling on days 5, 10, and 15 to evaluate seizure severity. 
Two hours after seizure severity test, tail suspension test and passive shock 
avoidance paradigm was employed to evaluate depression and cognitive behavior 
respectively. Results suggested that epileptic animals were significantly 
associated with depression and cognitive impairment. Chronic valproate treatment 
significantly reduced seizure severity, but was found unable to mitigate 
depression and cognitive deficits. However, agmatine treatment dose dependently 
ameliorated seizure severity as well as associated depression and cognitive 
deficits. On 15th day, animals were euthanized and pertinent neurochemical 
estimations were carried out in cortical and hippocampal areas of the mice 
brain. Thus, study concluded that agmatine ameliorated seizure severity, 
depression and cognitive impairment in epileptic animals, possibly via restoring 
glutamate-GABA neurotransmission and serotonin synthesis with decreased 
nitrosative stress.

In view of well-evidenced antiepileptic effects of melatonin and few reports of 
anticonvulsant action of agomelatine, the present study investigated whether 
agomelatine protects against pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced kindling in mice 
and kindling-associated oxidative stress, depression, and impairment of spatial 
memory. In order to explore whether effects are mediated by melatonergic or 
serotonergic mechanisms, 1-(m-chlorophenyl) piperazine (mCPP), selective 5HT2c 
receptor agonist and luzindole, melatonergic receptor antagonist, were taken as 
pharmacological tools. In view of few hepatotoxic reports on agomelatine, the 
study evaluated effects on hepatic enzyme levels. Swiss strain albino mice were 
injected with PTZ (25mg/kg, i.p.) once every two days for 5weeks to induce 
kindling. The effects of agomelatine (10mg/kg, p.o.) alone and in combination 
with luzindole (2.5mg/kg, i.p.) or mCPP (7mg/kg, i.p.) on seizure severity 
during induction and % incidence of animals kindled at the end of 5weeks were 
recorded. Modified forced swim test was used for studying depression-like 
behavior while spontaneous alternation behavior was used for studying effects on 
spatial memory. Serum AST and ALT concentrations, cortical and hippocampal 
malondialdehyde, and reduced glutathione were measured. Agomelatine 10mg/kg, 
p.o. effectively delayed development of kindling, reduced seizure severity, and 
decreased % incidence. Luzindole reversed the protective effects of agomelatine 
while mCPP failed to show such a reversal, indicating melatonergic (and not 
serotonergic) mechanisms in the observed effects. Agomelatine also showed 
antioxidant effects that can partially contribute to its anticonvulsant action. 
In addition, it alleviated PTZ-kindling-associated behavioral despair and 
favorably modulated liver enzymes. Its effects on improvement of 
kindling-associated spatial memory could possibly be related to its effects on 
locomotor activity. Agomelatine, thus, could be explored as an adjunct to 
antiepileptic drugs for seizure control and for alleviating epilepsy-associated 
depression.

AIM: To investigate the behavioral deficits, cognitive impairment and possible 
mechanisms induced by chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) in mice of different 
ages.
METHODS: The behaviors and cognition were tested using the open field test, tail 
suspension test and the Morris water maze. The changes in the insulin-like 
growth factor II (IGF-II) and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 
and phosphorylation (p-ERK) in the hippocampus (HP) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) 
were evaluated by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: The 15-month-old mice revealed a significant decline in spontaneous 
behavior and the learning-memory function and showed a decrease in IGF-II and 
p-ERK expression levels in HP and PFC. Four weeks of CUS exposure induced 
significant anxiety- and depression-like behavior and learning-memory function 
impairment in 3- to 15-month-old mice, and reduced IGF-II and p-ERK expression 
levels in HP and PFC, compared with control group mice, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The behavioral deficits and cognitive impairment induced by CUS and 
aging in mice could be associated with the down-regulated expression of IGF-II 
and p-ERK in HP and PFC. This role seems to be dependent on the intracellular 
ERK pathway.

Recent studies have demonstrated that behavioral traits are subject to 
transgenerational modification by paternal environmental factors. We previously 
reported on the transgenerational influences of increased paternal stress 
hormone levels on offspring anxiety and depression-related behaviors. Here, we 
investigated whether offspring sociability and cognition are also influenced by 
paternal stress. Adult C57BL/6J male mice were treated with corticosterone 
(CORT; 25mg/L) for four weeks prior to paired-matings to generate F1 offspring. 
Paternal CORT treatment was associated with decreased body weights of female 
offspring and a marked reduction of the male offspring. There were no 
differences in social behavior of adult F1 offspring in the three-chamber social 
interaction test. Despite male offspring of CORT-treated fathers displaying 
hyperactivity in the Y-maze, there was no observable difference in short-term 
spatial working memory. Spatial learning and memory testing in the Morris water 
maze revealed that female, but not male, F1 offspring of CORT-treated fathers 
had impaired memory retention. We used our recently developed methodology to 
analyze the spatial search strategy of the mice during the learning trials and 
determined that the impairment could not be attributed to underlying differences 
in search strategy. These results provide evidence for the impact of paternal 
corticosterone administration on offspring cognition and complement the 
cumulative knowledge of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of acquired 
traits in rodents and humans.

P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is an ABC transporter expressed at the blood brain barrier 
and regulates the brain uptake of various xenobiotics and endogenous mediators 
including glucocorticoid hormones which are critically important to the stress 
response. Moreover, P-gp is expressed on microglia, the brain's immune cells, 
which are activated by stressors and have an emerging role in psychiatric 
disorders. We therefore hypothesised that germline P-gp deletion in mice might 
alter the behavioral and microglial response to stressors. Female P-gp knockout 
mice displayed an unusual, frantic anxiety response to intraperitoneal injection 
stress in the light-dark test. They also tended to display reduced conditioned 
fear responses compared to wild-type (WT) mice in a paradigm where a single 
electric foot-shock stressor was paired to a context. Foot-shock stress reduced 
social interaction and decreased microglia cell density in the amygdala which 
was not varied by P-gp genotype. Independently of stressor exposure, female P-gp 
deficient mice displayed increased depression-like behavior, idiosyncratic 
darting behavior, age-related social withdrawal and hyperactivity, facilitated 
sensorimotor gating and altered startle reactivity. In addition, P-gp deletion 
increased microglia cell density in the CA3 region of the hippocampus, and the 
microglial cells exhibited a reactive, hypo-ramified morphology. Further, female 
P-gp KO mice displayed increased glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression in the 
hippocampus. In conclusion, this research shows that germline P-gp deletion 
affected various behaviors of relevance to psychiatric conditions, and that 
altered microglial cell activity and enhanced GR expression in the hippocampus 
may play a role in mediating these behaviors.

Chronic stress is a risk factor for major depression. Social defeat stress is a 
well-validated murine model of depression. However, little is known about the 
gene activity dynamics during the development of a depression-like state. We 
analyzed the effects of social defeat stress of varying duration (10 and 
30 days) on the behavioral patterns and prefrontal-cortex transcriptome of 
C57BL/6 mice. The 10-day exposure to social defeat stress resulted in a high 
level of social avoidance with no signs of depression-associated behavior. Most 
animals exposed to 30 days of social defeat stress demonstrated clear hallmarks 
of depression, including a higher level of social avoidance, increased 
immobility in the forced swimming test, and anhedonic behavior. The monitoring 
of transcriptome changes revealed widespread alterations in gene expression on 
the 10th day. Surprisingly, the expression of only a few genes were affected by 
the 30th day of stress, apparently due to a reversal of the majority of the 
early stress-induced changes to the original basal state. Moreover, we have 
found that glucocorticoid-sensitive genes are clearly stimulated targets on the 
10th day of stress, but these genes stop responding to the elevated 
corticosterone level by the 30th day of stress. The majority of genes altered by 
the 30-day stress were downregulated, with the most relevant ones participating 
in chromatin modifications and neuroplasticity (e.g., guanine nucleotide 
exchange factors of the Rho-family of GTPases). Very different molecular 
responses occur during short-term and long-term social stress in mice. The 
early-stress response is associated with social avoidance and with upregulation 
and downregulation of many genes, including those related to signal transduction 
and cell adhesion pathways. Downregulation of a few genes, in particular, genes 
for histone-modifying methyltransferases, is a signature response to prolonged 
stress that induces symptoms of depression. Altogether, our data show that the 
development of depression under social stress conditions is correlated with 
suppression of the overactive molecular response to induced stress, involving 
gene regulatory resistance to glucocorticoid molecules, potentially via a 
chromatin remodeling mechanism.

BACKGROUND: In recent years, proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) was 
considered to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of depression. In 
addition, P2X7 receptor (P2X7R), a member of the purinergic receptor family, 
which is predominantly present on microglia, as well as on astrocytes and 
neurons in lesser amounts in the central nervous system, was suggested to be 
involved in the processing and releasing of IL-1β. Here, we investigated the 
role of P2X7R in the pathogenesis of depression.
METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to chronic unpredictable 
stressors (CUS) for 3 weeks. At the end of week 1, 2, and 3, extracellular ATP, 
caspase 1, IL-1β, and components and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome 
(nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat, pyrin domain containing 3) were 
evaluated as biomarker of neuroinflammation. In separate experiments, the rats 
were microinjected with P2X7R agonists ATP, BzATP, and saline into the 
hippocampus, respectively, or exposed to CUS combined with hippocampal 
microinjection with P2X7R antagonist, BBG and A438079, and saline, respectively, 
for 3 weeks, followed by exposed to forced swimming test and open-field test. 
Moreover, we also evaluated the depressive and anxiety-like behavior of 
P2X7-null mice in forced swimming test, open-field test, and elevated plus maze.
RESULTS: Along with stress accumulation, extracellular ATP, cleaved-caspase 1, 
IL-1β, and ASC were significantly enhanced in the hippocampus, but P2X7R and 
NLRP3 were not. Immunoprecipitation assay indicated that along with the 
accumulation of stress, assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome and cleaved caspase 1 in 
NLRP3 inflammasome were significantly increased. Moreover, antagonists of P2X7R, 
either BBG or A438079, prevented the development of depressive-like behaviors 
induced by chronic unpredictable stress in rats. Meanwhile, we could not observe 
any depressive-like or anxiety-like behaviors of P2X7-null mice after they had 
been exposed to CUS. The results implied that P2X7 knockout could impede the 
development of depressive-like and anxiety-like behaviors induced by CUS. In 
contrast, chronic administration of agonists of P2X7R, either ATP or BzATP, 
could induce depressive-like behaviors.
CONCLUSIONS: The activation of P2X7R and subsequent NLRP3 inflammasome in 
hippocampal microglial cells could mediate depressive-like behaviors, which 
suggests a new therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of 
depression.

Objective To establish a postpartum depression animal model induced by 
pre-pregnancy stress,assess abnormal maternal depressive-like behavior,observe 
the expression of disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) in the hippocampus,and 
detect serum estradiol and corticosterone.Methods A total of 32 female Balb/c 
were assigned to two groups using random number table:the control group and the 
pre-pregnancy stressed group(model group),and the model group was subjected to 3 
weeks of chronic restraint stress. After the last stressor,the control group and 
the model group were housed with a male. About 4 weeks later,the mice gave birth 
to pups. Then at 3 weeks postpartum,open field test,tail suspension test,and 
sucrose preference test were carried out. The expressions of DISC1 mRNA and 
protein of hippocampus were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction and Western blot,respectively. The serum levels of estradiol and 
corticosterone were detected with enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Results 
After 3 weeks of postpartum,the model mice showed depression-like behaviors. In 
the open field test,there was no effect on the total distance moved or time 
spent in the center field (P>0.05). Immobility in tail suspension test was 
significantly increased (t=-4.950,P<0.001) and sucrose preference was 
significantly reduced in model group (t=2.475,P<0.05). There was significant 
statistical difference between control and model group on the expression of 
DISC1 mRNA (t=-8.915,P<0.001) and protein (t=-5.004,P<0.01) in hippocampus. 
There was no significant statistical difference on estradiol and corticosterone 
between two groups (P>0.05). Conclusion Chronic pre-pregnancy stress can induce 
dams into postpartum depression.The pathogenesis of postpartum depression may be 
related to the regulation of DISC1 in the hippocampus.

Breast cancer survivors are an expanding population that is troubled by lasting 
mental health problems, including depression and anxiety. These issues reduce 
quality-of-life throughout survivorhood. Research indicates that tumor biology, 
cancer treatments, and stress contribute to these mood disturbances. Although 
the mechanisms underlying these various causes remain under investigation, 
neuroinflammation is a leading hypothesis. To date, rodent models of 
recurrence-free tumor survival for understanding mechanisms by which these 
behavioral issues persist after cancer are lacking. Here, we test the extent to 
which potential behavioral symptoms persist after mammary tumor removal in mice 
(i.e., establishment of a cancer survivor model), while also empirically testing 
the causal role of tumors in the development of neuroinflammatory-mediated 
affective-like behaviors. Complete surgical resection of a non-metastatic 
orthotopic, syngeneic mammary tumor reversed tumor-induced increases of 
circulating cytokines (IL-6, CXCL1, IL-10) and myeloid-derived cells and 
modulated neuroinflammatory gene expression (Cd11b, Cxcl1). Multiple 
anxiety-like behaviors and some central and peripheral immune markers persisted 
or progressed three weeks after tumor resection. Together, these data indicate 
that persistent behavioral changes into cancer survivorhood may be due, in part, 
to changes in immunity that remain even after successful tumor removal. This 
novel survivor paradigm represents an improvement in modeling prevalent cancer 
survivorship issues and studying the basic mechanisms by which cancer/cancer 
treatments influence the brain and behavior.

BACKGROUND: Kososan, a Kampo (traditional Japanese herbal) medicine, has been 
used for the therapy of depressive mood in humans. However, evidence for the 
antidepressant efficacy of kososan and potential mechanisms are lacking. 
Recently, it has been recognized that stress triggers neuroinflammation and 
suppresses adult neurogenesis, leading to depression and anxiety. Here, we 
examined whether kososan extract affected social behavior in mice exposed to 
chronic social defeat stress (CSDS), an animal model of prolonged psychosocial 
stress, and neuroinflammation induced by CSDS.
METHODS: In the CSDS paradigm, C57BL/6J mice were exposed to 10 min of social 
defeat stress from an aggressive CD-1 mouse for 10 consecutive days (days 1-10). 
Kososan extract (1.0 g/kg) was administered orally once daily for 12 days (days 
1-12). On day 11, the social avoidance test was performed to examine depressive- 
and anxious-like behaviors. To characterize the impacts of kososan on 
neuroinflammation and adult neurogenesis, immunochemical analyses and ex vivo 
microglial stimulation assay with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were performed on 
days 13-15.
RESULTS: Oral administration of kososan extract alleviated social avoidance, 
depression- and anxiety-like behaviors, caused by CSDS exposure. CSDS exposure 
resulted in neuroinflammation, as indicated by the increased accumulation of 
microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, and their activation in the 
hippocampus, which was reversed to normal levels by treatment with kososan 
extract. Additionally, in ex vivo studies, CSDS exposure potentiated the 
microglial pro-inflammatory response to a subsequent LPS challenge, an effect 
that was also blunted by kososan extract treatment. Indeed, the modulatory 
effect of kososan extract on neuroinflammation appears to be due to a 
hippocampal increase in an anti-inflammatory phenotype of microglia while 
sparing an increased pro-inflammatory phenotype of microglia caused by CSDS. 
Moreover, reduced adult hippocampal neurogenesis in defeated mice was recovered 
by kososan extract treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that kososan extract prevents a social 
avoidant behavior in socially defeated mice that is partially mediated by the 
downregulation of hippocampal neuroinflammation, presumably by the relative 
increased anti-inflammatory microglia and regulation of adult hippocampal 
neurogenesis. Our present study also provides novel evidence for the beneficial 
effects of kososan on depression/anxiety and the possible underlying mechanisms.

There is an increased prevalence of comorbid major depressive disorders with a 
number of inflammatory conditions which is thought to result from activation of 
the immune system. Acute lung injury (ALI) in humans has been also shown to be 
associated with depression previously. However, no study has explored the 
mechanism behind ALI-induced depression. NADPH oxidase (NOX-2) derived reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) are associated with neuropsychiatric disorders including 
depression. ROS generation via NOX-2 is also shown to be involved in the 
pathogenesis of ALI. Therefore, we hypothesized that ROS generation may be a 
common link between ALI and depression. The present study utilized LPS model of 
ALI in mice to explore the effect of lung inflammation on depression-like 
behavior and further delineate the role of NOX-2 signaling in it. ALI led to 
enhanced NOX-2 activation in neutrophils/brain and neuronal oxidative stress 
which was concurrent with depression-like symptoms as assessed by sucrose 
preference and tail suspension test. Role of neutrophilic NOX-2 in ALI-induced 
depression was confirmed by depletion of neutrophils as well NOX-2 inhibitor, 
apocynin. Both of these approaches led to reduction in depressive symptoms 
induced by ALI. The present study suggests that ALI-induced upregulation of 
neutrophilic NOX-2/ROS may contribute to depression-like symptoms in mice.

The influence of sex on prevalence and presentation of human depression 
necessitates studying its role in depression. Additionally, stress can also 
affect the incidence and progression of depressive phenotypes. Hypothalamus is a 
well-reported sexually dimorphic brain region. Hence, we performed a gene-array 
to uncover the chronic stress-induced transcriptional changes in the 
hypothalamus of male, intact female (with ovaries) and ovariectomized female 
mice. Chronic variable mild stress model was used to induce depression-like 
behavior in mice, assessed by despair behavior in forced swim test. We observed 
90, 205 and 106 uniquely expressed genes among the 114, 226 and 121 
stress-regulated genes (fold change >1.2 and p < 0.05) in male, intact female, 
and ovariectomized female group mice respectively. Pathway analysis of the 
altered genes identified 'posttranslational processing of neuroendocrine 
peptides' as the most significantly enriched pathway and also differentially 
regulated among the groups. Arginine vasopressin and Cholecystokinin were 
upregulated in males whereas in ovariectomized females Arginine vasopressin 
alone was upregulated, and Oxytocin was downregulated in intact females. A 
greater number of nodes and connections found in intact females indicate their 
intricate molecular response to chronic stress condition. These results suggest 
that stress-regulated transcriptional changes in the hypothalamus are 
sex-specific and ovarian hormone-dependent, which warrants urgent sex-based 
medical attention in depressive disorder.

Brain development is a complex process regulated by genetic programs and 
activity-dependent neuronal connectivity. Anesthetics profoundly alter neuronal 
excitability, and anesthesia during early brain development has been 
consistently associated with neuroapoptosis, altered synaptogenesis, and 
persistent behavioral abnormalities in experimental animals. However, the depth, 
and even more the duration and developmental time point(s) of exposure to 
anesthesia determine the neuropathological and long-term behavioral consequences 
of anesthetics. Here, we have investigated adulthood phenotypic changes induced 
by repeated but brief (30 min) isoflurane anesthesia delivered during two 
distinct developmental periods in male mice. A set of animals were subjected to 
anesthesia treatments at postnatal days 7, 8 and 9 (P7-9) when the animals are 
susceptible to anesthesia-induced neuroapoptosis and reduced synaptogenesis. To 
control the potential influence of (handling) stress, a separate group of 
animals underwent repeated maternal separations of similar durations. Another 
set of animals were exposed to the same treatments at postnatal days 15, 16 and 
17 (P15-17), a developmental time period when anesthetics have been shown to 
increase synaptogenesis. Starting from postnatal week 9 the mouse phenotype was 
evaluated using a battery of behavioral tests that assess general locomotor 
activity (home cage activity, open field), learning and memory (water maze) and 
depression- (saccharin preference, forced swim test), anxiety- (light-dark box, 
stress-induced hyperthermia) and schizophrenia- (nesting, prepulse inhibition) 
related endophenotypes. Apart from mild impairment in spatial navigation memory, 
exposure to anesthesia treatments during P7-9 did not bring obvious behavioral 
alterations in adult animals. Importantly, maternal separation during the same 
developmental period produced a very similar phenotype during the water maze. 
Mice exposed to anesthesia during P15-17 showed mild hyperactivity and 
risk-taking behavior in adulthood, but were otherwise normal. We conclude that 
significantly longer administration periods are needed in order for early-life 
repeated exposures to anesthetics to produce behavioral alterations in adult 
mice.

RATIONALE: Major depressive disorder is a leading cause of suicide and 
disability. Despite this, current antidepressants provide insufficient efficacy 
in more than 60% of patients. Most current antidepressants are presynaptic 
reuptake inhibitors; postsynaptic signal regulation has not received as much 
attention as potential treatment targets.
OBJECTIVES: We examined the effects of disruption of the postsynaptic cyclic 
nucleotide hydrolyzing enzyme, phosphodiesterase (PDE) 1b, on depressive-like 
behavior and the effects on PDE1B protein in wild-type (WT) mice following 
stress.
METHODS: Littermate knockout (KO) and WT mice were tested in locomotor activity, 
tail suspension (TST), and forced swim tests (FST). FST was also used to compare 
the effects of two antidepressants, fluoxetine and bupropion, in KO versus WT 
mice. Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression changes were also determined. WT mice 
underwent acute or chronic stress and markers of stress and PDE1B expression 
were examined.
RESULTS: Pde1b KO mice exhibited decreased TST and FST immobility. When treated 
with antidepressants, both WT and KO mice showed decreased FST immobility and 
the effect was additive in KO mice. Mice lacking Pde1b had increased striatal 
Pde10a mRNA expression. In WT mice, acute and chronic stress upregulated PDE1B 
expression while PDE10A expression was downregulated after chronic but not acute 
stress.
CONCLUSIONS: PDE1B is a potential therapeutic target for depression treatment 
because of the antidepressant-like phenotype seen in Pde1b KO mice.

There has been an increasing interest in relationship between stress and diet. 
To address this relationship, we evaluated an animal model of depression: male 
C57BL/6J mice subjected to subchronic mild social defeat stress (sCSDS) for 10 
consecutive days using male ICR mice under two different calorie-adjusted diets 
conditions-nonpurified (MF) and semipurified (AIN) diets made from natural and 
chemical ingredients mainly, respectively. Our previous study indicates that 
diet quality and purity affect stress susceptibility in sCSDS mice. We therefore 
hypothesized that there are some key peripheral metabolites to change 
stress-susceptible behavior. GC-MS metabolomics of plasma, liver, and cecal 
content were performed on four test groups: sCSDS + AIN diet (n = 7), sCSDS + MF 
diet (n = 6), control (no sCSDS) + AIN diet (n = 8), and control + MF diet (n = 
8). Metabolome analyses revealed that the number of metabolites changed by food 
was larger than the number changed by stress in all tissues. Enrichment analysis 
of the liver metabolite set altered by food implies that stress-susceptible mice 
show increased glycolysis-related substrates in the liver. We found metabolites 
that were affected by stress (e.g., plasma and liver 4-hydroxyproline and plasma 
beta-alanine are higher in sCSDS than in control) and a stress × food 
interaction (e.g., plasma GABA is lower in sCSDS + AIN than in sCSDS + MF). 
Because functional compounds were altered by both stress and food, diet may be 
able to attenuate various stress-induced symptoms by changing metabolites in 
peripheral tissues.

New antidepressant pharmacotherapies that provide rapid relief of depressive 
symptoms are needed. The NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine exerts rapid 
antidepressant actions in depressed patients but also side effects that 
complicate its clinical utility. Ketamine promotes excitatory synaptic strength, 
likely by producing high-frequency correlated activity in mood-relevant regions 
of the forebrain. Negative allosteric modulators of GABA-A receptors containing 
α5 subunits (α5 GABA-NAMs) should also promote high-frequency correlated 
electroencephalogram (EEG) activity and should therefore exert rapid 
antidepressant responses. Because α5 subunits display a restricted expression in 
the forebrain, we predicted that α5 GABA-NAMs would produce activation of 
principle neurons but exert fewer side effects than ketamine. We tested this 
hypothesis in male mice and observed that the α5 GABA-NAM MRK-016 exerted an 
antidepressant-like response in the forced swim test at 1 and 24 h after 
administration and an anti-anhedonic response after chronic stress in the female 
urine sniffing test (FUST). Like ketamine, MRK-016 produced a transient increase 
in EEG γ power, and both the increase in γ power and its antidepressant effects 
in the forced swim test were blocked by prior administration of the AMPA-type 
glutamate receptor antagonist 
2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide (NBQX). 
Unlike ketamine, however, MRK-016 produced no impairment of rota-rod 
performance, no reduction of prepulse inhibition (PPI), no conditioned-place 
preference (CPP), and no change in locomotion. α5 GABA-NAMs, thus reproduce the 
rapid antidepressant-like actions of ketamine, perhaps via an AMPA receptor 
(AMPAR)-dependent increase in coherent neuronal activity, but display fewer 
potential negative side effects. These compounds thus demonstrate promise as 
clinically useful fast-acting antidepressants.

Mother-infant contact has a critical role on brain development and behavior. 
Experiencing early-life adversities (such as maternal separation stress or MS in 
rodents) results in adaptations of neurotransmission systems, which may 
subsequently increase the risk of depression symptoms later in life. In this 
study, we show that Oxytocin (OT) exerted antioxidant and anti-inflammatory 
properties. Previous studies indicate that neuroinflammation and mitochondrial 
dysfunction are associated with the pathophysiology of depression. To 
investigate the antidepressant-like effects of OT, we applied MS paradigm (as a 
valid animal model of depression) to male mice at postnatal day (PND) 2 to PND 
14 (3h daily, 9AM to 12AM) and investigated the depressive-like behaviors of 
these animals at PND 60 in different groups. Animals in this work were divided 
into 4 experimental groups: 1) saline-treated, 2) OT-treated, 3) atosiban (OT 
antagonist)-treated and, 4) OT+ atosiban-treated mice. We used forced swimming 
test (FST), splash test, sucrose preference test (SPT) and open field test (OFT) 
for behavioral assessment. Additionally, we used another set of animals to 
investigate the effects of MS and different treatments on mitochondrial function 
and the expression of the relevant genes for neuroinflammation. Our results 
showed that MS provoked depressive- like behaviors in the FST, SPT and splash 
test. In addition, our molecular findings revealed that MS is capable of 
inducing abnormal mitochondrial function and immune-inflammatory response in the 
hippocampus. Further, we observed that treating stressed animals with OT 
(intracerebroventricular, i.c.v. injection) attenuated the MS-induced 
depressive-like behaviors through improving mitochondrial function and 
decreasing the hippocampal expression of immune-inflammatory genes. In 
conclusion, we showed that MS-induced depressive-like behaviors in adult male 
mice are associated with abnormal mitochondrial function and immune-inflammatory 
responses in the hippocampus, and activation of OTergic system has protective 
effects against negative effects of MS on brain and behavior of animals.

Prenatal stressors in rodents: Effects on behavior.

The current review focuses on studies in rodents published since 2008 and 
explores possible reasons for any differences they report in the effects of 
gestational stress on various types of behavior in the offspring. An abundance 
of experimental data shows that different maternal stressors in rodents can 
replicate some of the abnormalities in offspring behavior observed in humans. 
These include, anxiety, in juvenile and adult rats and mice, assessed in the 
elevated plus maze and open field tests and depression, detected in the forced 
swim and sucrose-preference tests. Deficits were reported in social interaction 
that is suggestive of pathology associated with schizophrenia, and in spatial 
learning and memory in adult rats in the Morris water maze test, but in most 
studies only males were tested. There were too few studies on the novel object 
recognition test at different inter-trial intervals to enable a conclusion about 
the effect of prenatal stress and whether any deficits are more prevalent in 
males. Among hippocampal glutamate receptors, NR2B was the only subtype 
consistently reduced in association with learning deficits. However, like in 
humans with schizophrenia and depression, prenatal stress lowered hippocampal 
levels of BDNF, which were closely correlated with decreases in hippocampal 
long-term potentiation. In mice, down-regulation of BDNF appeared to occur 
through the action of gene-methylating enzymes that are already increased above 
controls in prenatally-stressed neonates. In conclusion, the data obtained so 
far from experiments in rodents lend support to a physiological basis for the 
neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia and depression.

OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to evaluate whether chronic Rosa canina (RC) 
extract administration could improve recognition memory and depressive-like 
behavior in diabetic mice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-five male albino mice (25-30 g) were randomly 
divided into 5 groups (15 in each group). A single intraperitoneal injection of 
200 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ) was administered to the mice to induce diabetes. 
The control group received normal saline, and the diabetic groups received 
normal saline or 50, 250, and 500 mg/kg of RC extract for 28 days. The mice were 
weighed each week. Recognition memory and depressive-like behavior were assessed 
using forced swimming and novel object recognition (NOR) tests, respectively. 
Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were measured 
in the mouse brain homogenate to evaluate oxidative stress. Statistical analysis 
was conducted using SPSS, version 22.
RESULTS: The groups receiving 250 or 500 mg/kg RC had significantly lower 
immobility time (159.4 ± 4.7 and 150.1 ± 3.1 s) compared to the sham control 
group (192.1 ± 7.8 s) in the forced swimming test, and a higher discrimination 
index (0.39 ± 0.02 and 0.48 ± 0.03) was seen in diabetic animals in the NOR task 
compared to the sham control group (0.2 ± 0.01). Also, the groups receiving 
treatment with RC (250 and 500 mg/kg) had significantly higher TAC (0.92 ± 0.04 
and 0.96 ± 0.05 mmol/L) and lower MDA (0.76 ± 0.02 and 0.67 ± 0.03 nmol/mg 
protein) levels in the brains in comparison to the model group. In the 3rd and 
4th weeks of study, the RC-treated mice (250 and 500 mg/kg) gained more weight 
(31.2 ± 0.3 and 32.4 ± 0.3 g, and 31.3 ± 0.2 and 33.7 ± 0.3 g, respectively) 
than the diabetic group (30 ± 0.2 and 29.6 ± 0.3 g).
CONCLUSION: This study showed that RC attenuated impairment of recognition 
memory and depressive-like behavior probably through modulation of oxidative 
stress in an STZ model of diabetes in mouse brains.

The somatostatin 4 receptor (sst4) is widely expressed in stress-related brain 
areas (e.g. hippocampus, amygdala) and regulates the emotional behavior in acute 
situations. Since its importance in chronic stress-induced complex 
pathophysiological alterations is unknown, we investigated the involvement of 
sst4 in the responsiveness to chronic variable stress (CVS). Sstr4 
gene-deficient (Sstr4-/-) mice and their wildtype counterparts (Sstr4+/+) were 
used to examine the behavioral and neuroendocrine alterations as well as chronic 
neuronal activity (FosB expression) changes in response to CVS. In Sstr4+/+ 
mice, there was no behavioral response to the applied CVS paradigm. In contrast, 
immobility time in the tail suspension test increased after the CVS in the 
knockouts. In the forced swim test, Sstr4-/- animals showed increased baseline 
immobility and then it decreased after the CVS. Light-dark box and open field 
test behaviors and sucrose preference did not respond to the stress in the 
knockouts. Adrenal weights increased and thymus weights decreased in both 
Sstr4+/+ and Sstr4-/- mice demonstrating the effect of chronic stress. The 
relative adrenal weight of stressed knockouts increased to a greater extent, 
while relative thymus and body weights decreased only in the Sstr4-/- mice. 
Basal plasma corticosterone concentrations did not change after the CVS in 
either genotype. FosB immunopositivity in the central and basolateral amygdaloid 
nuclei was enhanced in stressed knockouts, but not in wild types. This is the 
first evidence that sst4 activation is involved in the behavioral and 
neuroendocrine alterations induced by chronic stress with a crucial role of 
plastic changes in the amygdala.

Evidence suggests that neuroinflammation is involved in depression and that the 
cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLT1R) plays a potential pathophysiological 
role in several types of CNS disorders. Our previous study has shown that 
knockdown of hippocampal CysLT1R in mice prevents the depressive-like phenotype 
and neuroinflammation induced by chronic mild stress (CMS). Here, we examined 
the effects of hippocampal CysLT1R knockdown and CysLT1R blockade on LPS-induced 
depressive-like behavior in mice. We found that injection of LPS (0.5 mg/kg, ip) 
caused marked increase in hippocampal CysLT1R expression, which was reversed by 
pretreatment with fluoxetine (20 mg·kg-1·d-1 for 7 d, ig). Knockdown of 
hippocampal CysLT1R or blockade of CysLT1R by pretreatment with pranlukast (0.5 
mg/kg, ip) significantly suppressed LPS-induced depressive behaviors, as 
evidenced by decreases in mouse immobility time in the forced swimming test 
(FST) and tail suspension test (TST) and latency to feed in the 
novelty-suppressed feeding (NSF) test. Moreover, both CysLT1R knockdown and 
CysLT1R blockade markedly prevented LPS-induced neuroinflammation, as shown by 
the suppressed activation of microglia and NF-κB signaling as well as the 
hippocampal levels of TNF-α and IL-1β in mice. Our results suggest that CysLT1R 
may be involved in LPS-induced depressive-like behaviors and neuroinflammation, 
and that downregulation of CysLT1R could be a novel and potential therapeutic 
strategy for the treatment of depression, at least partially due to its role in 
neuroinflammation.

Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) plays an inhibitory role in the mature brain, and 
has a complex and bidirectional effect in different parts of the immature brain 
which affects proliferation, migration and differentiation of neurons during 
development. There is also increasing evidence suggesting that activation or 
blockade of the GABA-A receptors during early life can induce brain and 
behavioral abnormalities in adulthood. We investigated whether neonatal blockade 
of the GABA-A receptors by bicuculline can alter anxiety- and depression-like 
behaviors, body weight, food intake, corticosterone and testosterone levels in 
adult mice (postnatal days 80-95). To this end, neonatal mice were treated with 
either DMSO or bicuculline (70, 150 and 300μg/kg) during postnatal days 7, 9 and 
11. When grown to adulthood, mice were exposed to behavioral tests to measure 
anxiety- (elevated plus-maze and light-dark box) and depression-like behaviors 
(tail suspension test and forced swim test). Stress-induced serum corticosterone 
and testosterone levels, body weight and food intake were also evaluated. 
Neonatal bicuculline exposure at dose of 300μg/kg decreased anxiety-like 
behavior, stress-induced corticosterone levels and increased testosterone 
levels, body weight and food intake, without significantly influencing 
depression-like behavior in adult male mice. However, no significant changes in 
these parameters were observed in adult females. These findings suggest that 
neonatal blockade of GABA-A receptors affects anxiety-like behavior, 
physiological and hormonal parameters in a sex-dependent manner in mice. Taken 
together, these data corroborate the concept that GABA-A receptors during early 
life have an important role in programming neurobehavioral phenotypes in 
adulthood.

Recent studies have demonstrated that paternal stress in rodents can result in 
modification of offspring behavior. Environmental enrichment, which enhances 
cognitive stimulation and physical activity, modifies various behaviors and 
reduces stress responses in adult rodents. We investigated the transgenerational 
influence of paternal environmental enrichment on offspring behavior and 
physiological stress response. Adult C57BL/6J male mice (F0) were exposed to 
either environmental enrichment or standard housing for four weeks and then 
pair-mated with naïve females. The F2 generation was generated using F1 male 
offspring. Male and female F1 and F2 offspring were tested for anxiety using the 
elevated-plus maze and large open field at 8 weeks of age. Depression-related 
behavior was assessed using the forced-swim test. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal 
(HPA) axis function was determined by quantification of serum corticosterone and 
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels at baseline and after forced-swim 
stress. Paternal environmental enrichment was associated with increased body 
weights of male F1 and F2 offspring. There was no significant effect on F1 
offspring anxiety and depression-related behaviors. There were no changes in 
anxiety-related behaviors in the F2 offspring, however these mice displayed a 
reduced latency to immobility in the forced-swim test. Furthermore, F2 females 
had significantly higher serum corticosterone levels post-stress, but not ACTH. 
These results show that paternal environmental enrichment exerts a sex-specific 
transgenerational impact on the behavioral and physiological response to stress. 
Our findings have implications for the modelling of psychiatric disorders in 
rodents.

Adolescence is a time period in development when the brain undergoes substantial 
remodeling in response to the environment. To determine whether a stressful 
experience during adolescence affects adult behavior, we exposed adolescent male 
and female C57BL/6J mice to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) for 12 days 
starting at postnatal day 28 (PND28). We also exposed adult male and female mice 
to CUS for 12 days beginning at PND70 to determine whether adolescence is a 
sensitive time period when stress can have long-lasting effects on behavior. 
Regardless of when mice were exposed to stress, they were all tested exactly 30 
days later in the marble burying task, elevated zero maze, acoustic startle 
response, and forced swim test. Adolescent stress exposure increased 
anxiety-like behaviors in adult male and female mice and decreased acoustic 
startle response in a sex-dependent manner. However, adult stress exposure did 
not change anxiety or response to an acoustic tone in adult male or female mice 
as compared with nonstressed animals. Of interest, increased depression-like 
behavior in the forced swim test was observed in all mice, regardless of when 
the stress occurred. Gene expression analysis showed significant upregulation of 
corticotropin releasing factor receptor 2 (CrfR2) in the amygdala of males 
subjected to CUS during adolescence, but not in males that experienced CUS 
during adulthood. In contrast, females, regardless of when they were exposed to 
CUS, were not affected. These data support clinical evidence suggesting that 
early-life stress may predispose individuals to increased anxiety and depression 
later in life.

BACKGROUND: Abundant researches indicate that neuroinflammation has important 
roles in the pathophysiology of depression. Our previous study found that the 
NLRP3 inflammasome mediated stress-induced depression-like behavior in mice via 
regulating neuroinflammation. However, it still remains unclear that how the 
NLRP3 inflammasome influences related inflammatory signaling pathway to 
contribute to neuroinflammation in depression.
METHODS: We used wild-type mice and NLRP3 gene knockout mice to explore the role 
of NLRP3 inflammasome and related inflammatory signaling pathways in chronic 
unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) induced depression mouse model.
RESULTS: Both wild-type and NLRP3 knockout stress group mice gained less weight 
than control group mice after 4 weeks CUMS exposure. The wild-type mice 
subjected to 4 weeks CUMS displayed depression-like behaviors, including 
decreased sucrose preference and increased immobility time in the tail 
suspension test. The NLRP3 knockout stress group mice didn't demonstrate 
depression-like behaviors. The levels of interleukin-1β protein in serum and 
hippocampi of CUMS exposed wild-type mice were significantly higher, while the 
NLRP3 knockout stress group mice didn't show an elevation of interleukin-1β 
levels. Similarly to early researches, we found that CUMS led to promoted NLRP3 
expression in hippocampi. In addition, the hippocampi in CUMS exposed wild-type 
mice had higher p-JNK and p-p38 protein expression, which indicated activation 
of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway. The knockout of NLRP3 
gene inhibited CUMS-induced activation of the MAPK pathway. The nuclear factor 
kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) protein complex was 
activated in the hippocampi of wild-type mice after CUMS exposure, while 
knockout of NLRP3 gene hindered its activation.
CONCLUSIONS: These data further proved that the NLRP3 inflammasome mediated 
CUMS-induced depression-like behavior. The NLRP3 inflammasome regulated 
CUMS-induced MAPK pathway and NF-κB protein complex activation in depression 
mouse model. Further researches targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome-signaling 
pathway might be under a promising future in the prevention and treatment of 
depression.

RATIONALE: There is accumulating evidence for a role of GABAB receptors in 
depression. GABAB receptors are heterodimers of GABAB1 and GABAB2 receptor 
subunits. The predominant GABAB1 subunit isoforms are GABAB1a and GABAB1b. 
GABAB1 isoforms in mice differentially influence cognition, conditioned fear, 
and susceptibility to stress, yet their influence in tests of 
antidepressant-like activity has not been fully investigated.
OBJECTIVES: Given the interactions between GABAB receptors and the serotonergic 
system and the involvement of 5-HT1A receptors (5-HT1AR) in antidepressant 
action, we sought to evaluate 5-HT1AR function in GABAB1a-/- and GABAB1b-/- 
mice.
METHODS: GABAB1a-/- and GABAB1b-/- mice were assessed in the forced swim test 
(FST), and body temperature and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) responses 
to the 5-HT1AR agonist 8-OH-DPAT were determined. Brain 5-HT1AR expression was 
assessed by [3H]-MPPF and [3H]-8-OH-DPAT autoradiography and 5-HT1AR G-protein 
coupling by [35S]GTP-γ-S autoradiography.
RESULTS: As previously described, GABAB1a-/- mice showed an antidepressant-like 
profile in the FST. GABAB1a-/- mice also demonstrated profoundly blunted 
hypothermic and motoric responses to 8-OH-DPAT. Furthermore, 8-OH-DPAT-induced 
corticosterone and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) release were both 
attenuated in GABAB1a-/- mice. Interestingly, [3H]-MPPF and [3H]-8-OH-DPAT 
binding was largely unaffected by genotype. [35S]GTP-γ-S autoradiography 
suggested that altered 5-HT1AR G-protein coupling only partially contributes to 
the functional presynaptic 5-HT1AR desensitization, and not at all to the 
blunted postsynaptic 5-HT1AR-mediated responses, seen in GABAB1a-/- mice.
CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate distinct functional links between 5-HT1ARs 
and the GABAB1a subunit isoform and suggest that the GABAB1a isoform may be 
implicated in the antidepressant-like effects of GABAB receptor antagonists and 
in neurobiological mechanisms underlying depression.

In rodents, chronic social defeat stress promotes deficits in social interest 
and social interaction. We further explored these antisocial effects by 
comparing the consequences of two different defeat stress protocols (episodic 
vs. continuous stress) in a social investigation test. We expected that 
continuous, but not episodic, stress would induce social deficits in this model. 
Furthermore, we tested whether a potentially anxiolytic dose of ethanol reverses 
social deficits induced by defeat stress. Male Swiss mice were exposed to a 
10-day social defeat protocol, using daily confrontations with an aggressive 
resident mouse. Episodic stress consisted of brief defeat episodes, after which 
the defeated mouse was returned to its home cage, until the next defeat 24 h 
later (n = 7-11/group). For continuous stress, similar defeat episodes were 
followed by cohabitation with the aggressive resident for 24 h, separated by a 
perforated divider, until the following defeat (n = 8-14/group). Eight days 
after stress termination, defeated and control mice were assessed in a social 
investigation test, after treatment with ethanol (1.0 g/kg, i.p.) or 0.9% 
saline. Considering the time spent investigating a social target, mice exposed 
to episodic or continuous social stress showed less social investigation than 
controls (p < .05). Deficits in social interest were not reversed by acute 
ethanol treatment. However, ethanol reduced time spent in social interaction in 
one control group (p < .05). Locomotor activity was not affected by social 
stress or ethanol. Thus, a history of social defeat stress, whether episodic or 
continuous, promotes deficits in social investigation that were not reversed by 
acute treatment with ethanol.

The unpredictable and inescapable electric shock-induced "learned helplessness" 
paradigm has long been used to produce an animal model of depression to identify 
the molecules associated with depressive symptoms or to assess the efficacy of 
pharmacological treatments for depression. After exposure to unpredictable and 
inescapable shocks (uncontrollable stress), most of mice showed defect in escape 
behavior in active avoidance test (learned helplessness, LH), while others did 
not (non-learned helplessness, NLH). Here, we investigated whether mice with LH 
or NLH exhibited depressive symptoms, including anhedonia, anxiety, and despair. 
We found that compared with control naïve mice, both uncontrollable 
shocks-induced LH and NLH mice showed increased anhedonia- and anxiety- but not 
despair-like behaviors. Notably, mice subjected to uncontrollable shocks showed 
similar behaviors, irrespective of whether they also showed LH or NLH. 
Furthermore, since both LH and NLH mice showed only anhedonia- and anxiety- but 
not despair-like behaviors, this model may be generally inadequate for classic 
depression-like behavior assessment. In conclusion, uncontrollable electric 
shock induces depression-like behavior, irrespective of the state of 
helplessness.

Comment in
    eNeuro. 2017 Apr 20;4(2):

The development of animal models with construct, face, and predictive validity 
to accurately model human depression has been a major challenge. One proposed 
rodent model is the 5 d repeated forced swim stress (5d-RFSS) paradigm, which 
progressively increases floating during individual swim sessions. The onset and 
persistence of this floating behavior has been anthropomorphically characterized 
as a measure of depression. This interpretation has been under debate because a 
progressive increase in floating over time may reflect an adaptive learned 
behavioral response promoting survival, and not depression (Molendijk and de 
Kloet, 2015). To assess construct and face validity, we applied 5d-RFSS to 
C57BL/6J and BALB/cJ mice, two mouse strains commonly used in neuropsychiatric 
research, and measured a combination of emotional, homeostatic, and psychomotor 
symptoms indicative of a depressive-like state. We also compared the efficacy of 
5d-RFSS and chronic social defeat stress (CSDS), a validated depression model, 
to induce a depressive-like state in C57BL/6J mice. In both strains, 5d-RFSS 
progressively increased floating behavior that persisted for at least 4 weeks. 
5d-RFSS did not alter sucrose preference, body weight, appetite, locomotor 
activity, anxiety-like behavior, or immobility behavior during a tail-suspension 
test compared with nonstressed controls. In contrast, CSDS altered several of 
these parameters, suggesting a depressive-like state. Finally, predictive 
validity was assessed using voluntary wheel running (VWR), a known 
antidepressant intervention. Four weeks of VWR after 5d-RFSS normalized floating 
behavior toward nonstressed levels. These observations suggest that 5d-RFSS has 
no construct or face validity but might have predictive validity to model human 
depression.

Social stress, including bullying during adolescence, is a risk factor for 
common psychopathologies such as depression. To investigate the neural 
mechanisms associated with juvenile social stress-induced mood-related 
endophenotypes, we examined the behavioral, morphological, and biochemical 
effects of the social defeat stress model of depression on hippocampal dendritic 
spines within the CA1 stratum radiatum. Adolescent (postnatal day 35) male 
C57BL/6 mice were subjected to defeat episodes for 10 consecutive days. 
Twenty-four h later, separate groups of mice were tested on the social 
interaction and tail suspension tests. Hippocampi were then dissected and 
Western blots were conducted to quantify protein levels for various markers 
important for synaptic plasticity including protein kinase M zeta (PKMζ), 
protein kinase C zeta (PKCζ), the dopamine-1 (D1) receptor, tyrosine hydroxylase 
(TH), and the dopamine transporter (DAT). Furthermore, we examined the presence 
of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-receptor 
subunit GluA2 as well as colocalization with the post-synaptic density 95 
(PSD95) protein, within different spine subtypes (filopodia, stubby, long-thin, 
mushroom) using an immunohistochemistry and Golgi-Cox staining technique. The 
results revealed that social defeat induced a depression-like behavioral 
profile, as inferred from decreased social interaction levels, increased 
immobility on the tail suspension test, and decreases in body weight. Whole 
hippocampal immunoblots revealed decreases in GluA2, with a concomitant increase 
in DAT and TH levels in the stressed group. Spine morphology analyses further 
showed that defeated mice displayed a significant decrease in stubby spines, and 
an increase in long-thin spines within the CA1 stratum radiatum. Further 
evaluation of GluA2/PSD95 containing-spines demonstrated a decrease of these 
markers within long-thin and mushroom spine types. Together, these results 
indicate that juvenile social stress induces GluA2- and dopamine-associated 
dysregulation in the hippocampus - a neurobiological mechanism potentially 
underlying the development of mood-related syndromes as a consequence of 
adolescent bullying.

Pioglitazone, a PPARγ agonist rescues depression associated with obesity using 
chronic unpredictable mild stress model in experimental mice.

Pioglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonist 
belonging to thiazolidinedione class, is mainly used in diabetes mellitus. Obese 
subjects are twice likely to become depressed than non-obese individuals. The 
biological mechanisms linking depression with obesity still remain poorly 
understood and there is immense need for better therapeutic intervention against 
such co-morbid disorders. The present study investigates the effect of 
pioglitazone on the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) induced depression 
in obese mice by using behavioral tests and biochemical estimations. Mice were 
fed with high fat diet (HFD) for 14 weeks and were further subjected to 
different stress procedures for 28 days to induce depressive behavior. Animals 
were administered orally with pioglitazone (30 mg/kg p.o.)/escitalopram 
(10 mg/kg p.o.)/vehicle (10 ml/kg p.o.) daily from day 15-28. Various behavioral 
paradigms such as sucrose preference test, forced swim test (FST), tail 
suspension test (TST) and elevated plus maze (EPM) were performed. Biochemical 
estimations including plasma glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and 
total proteins were performed. The data obtained from behavioral assays and 
biochemical assessments indicated that obese animals exhibited severe 
depressive-like behavior compared to non-obese animals. Furthermore, obese 
animals subjected to CUMS worsen the depressive behavior compared to obese 
control animals. Repetitive treatment with pioglitazone reversed the CUMS 
induced behavioral and biochemical alterations in HFD fed obese mice which 
atleast in part may be mediated through improving altered plasma glucose. The 
study suggests that pioglitazone needs further attention with respect to 
molecular mechanisms that could provide a better therapeutic strategy against 
depression associated with obesity.

Magnesium Isoglycyrrhizinate (MI) is a magnesium salt of 18α-GA stereoisomer 
which has been reported to exert hepatoprotective activity. The aim of the 
present study was to ascertain the underlying mechanisms behind the action of 
Magnesium Isoglycyrrhizinate on neuroinflammatation and oxidative stress in 
LPS-stimulated mice. Mice were pretreated with Magnesium Isoglycyrrhizinate (MI, 
25, 50mg/kg) as well as fluoxetine (Flu, positive control, 20mg/kg) once daily 
for one week before intraperitoneal injection of LPS (0.83mg/kg). Pretreatments 
with MI and Flu significantly improved immobility time in tail suspension test 
(TST) and forced swim test (FST) as well as locomotor activity in open-field 
test (OFT). In addition, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative 
stress in serum and hippocampus were also suppressed effectively by MI and Flu 
administrations. Western blot analysis showed the up-regulated levels of p-Jak3, 
p-STAT3, p-NF-κBp65, and p-IκBα in mice exposed to LPS, while different degrees 
of down-regulation in these expression were observed in MI (25, 50mg/kg) and Flu 
(20mg/kg) groups respectively. Taken together, our obtained results demonstrated 
that Magnesium Isoglycyrrhizinate (MI) exhibited an antidepressant-like effect 
in LPS-induced mice, which might be mediated by JAK/STAT/NF-κB signaling 
pathway.

Psychosocial stress can cause mental conditions such as depression in humans. To 
develop drug therapies for the treatment of depression, it is necessary to use 
animal models of depression to screen drug candidates that exhibit 
anti-depressive effects. Unfortunately, the present methods of drug screening 
for antidepressants, the forced-swim test and tail-suspension test, are limiting 
factors in drug discovery because they are not based on the constructive 
validity of objective phenotypes in depression. Previously, we discovered that 
the onset of nest building is severely delayed in mice exposed to subchronic 
mild social defeat stress (sCSDS). Therefore, a novel paradigm combining acute 
social defeat stress (ASDS) and the nest-building test (SNB) were established 
for the efficient screening of drugs for depressive-like symptoms. Since ASDS 
severely delayed the nest-building process as shown in chronically social 
defeated mice, we sought to rescue the delayed nest-building behavior in ASDS 
mice. Injecting a specific serotonin 2a receptor antagonist (SR-46349B), the 
nest-building deficit exhibited by ASDS mice was partially rescued. On the other 
hand, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (fluoxetine) did not rescue the 
nest-building deficit in ASDS mice. Therefore, we conclude that the SNB paradigm 
is an another potential behavioral method for screening drugs for 
depressive-like symptoms including attention deficit, anxiety, low locomotion, 
and decreased motivation.

Apathy is considered to be a core feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) and has 
been associated with a variety of states and symptoms of the disease, such as 
increased severity of motor symptoms, impaired cognition, executive dysfunction 
and dementia. Apart from the high prevalence of apathy in PD, which is estimated 
to be about 40%, the underlying pathophysiology remains poorly understood and 
current treatment approaches are unspecific and proved to be only partially 
effective. In animal models, apathy has been sub-optimally modeled, mostly by 
means of pharmacological and stress-induced methods, whereby concomitant 
depressive-like symptoms could not be ruled out. In the context of PD only a few 
studies on toxin-based models (i.e., 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) or 
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)) claimed to have determined 
apathetic symptoms in animals. The assessment of apathetic symptoms in more 
elaborated and multifaceted genetic animal models of PD could help to understand 
the pathophysiological development of apathy in PD and eventually advance 
specific treatments for afflicted patients. Here we report the presence of 
behavioral signs of apathy in 12 months old mice that express only ~5% of the 
vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2). Apathetic-like behavior in VMAT2 
deficient (LO) mice was evidenced by impaired burrowing and nest building 
skills, and a reduced preference for sweet solution in the saccharin preference 
test, while the performance in the forced swimming test was normal. Our 
preliminary results suggest that VMAT2 deficient mice show an apathetic-like 
phenotype that might be independent of depressive-like symptoms. Therefore VMAT2 
LO mice could be a useful tool to study the pathophysiological substrates of 
apathy and to test novel treatment strategies for apathy in the context of PD.

The polymorphic CYP2C19 enzyme metabolizes psychoactive compounds and is 
expressed in the adult liver and fetal brain. Previously, we demonstrated that 
the absence of CYP2C19 is associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms in 
1472 Swedes. Conversely, transgenic mice carrying the human CYP2C19 gene 
(2C19TG) have shown an anxious phenotype and decrease in hippocampal volume and 
adult neurogenesis. The aims of this study were to: (1) examine whether the 
2C19TG findings could be translated to humans, (2) evaluate the usefulness of 
the 2C19TG strain as a tool for preclinical screening of new antidepressants and 
(3) provide an insight into the molecular underpinnings of the 2C19TG phenotype. 
In humans, we found that the absence of CYP2C19 was associated with a bilateral 
hippocampal volume increase in two independent healthy cohorts (N=386 and 1032) 
and a lower prevalence of major depressive disorder and depression severity in 
African-Americans (N=3848). Moreover, genetically determined high CYP2C19 
enzymatic capacity was associated with higher suicidality in depressed suicide 
attempters (N=209). 2C19TG mice showed high stress sensitivity, impaired 
hippocampal Bdnf homeostasis in stress, and more despair-like behavior in the 
forced swim test (FST). After the treatment with citalopram and 5-HT1A receptor 
agonist 8OH-DPAT, the reduction in immobility time in the FST was more 
pronounced in 2C19TG mice compared with WTs. Conversely, in the 2C19TG 
hippocampus, metabolic turnover of serotonin was reduced, whereas ERK1/2 and 
GSK3β phosphorylation was increased. Altogether, this study indicates that 
elevated CYP2C19 expression is associated with depressive symptoms, reduced 
hippocampal volume and impairment of hippocampal serotonin and BDNF homeostasis.

Catalepsy is an inability to correct an externally imposed awkward posture; it 
is associated with schizophrenia and depression in human. We created new 
recombinant B6.CBA-D13Mit76C and B6.CBA-D13Mit76B mouse lines on the C57Bl/6 
genome, carrying the 102.73-110.56Mbp fragment of chromosome 13 derived from the 
catalepsy-prone CBA strain and catalepsy-resistant C57BL/6 strain, respectively. 
We compared the behavior and brain morphology (11.7T BioSpec 117/16 USR 
tomograph, Germany) in these lines. The effects of acute emotional stress on 
corticosterone's level in the blood and mRNA expression of Bdnf and Arc genes in 
the brain were investigated. The B6.CBA-D13Mit76B mice were non-cataleptic, 
while about 17% of B6.CBA-D13Mit76C mice demonstrated catalepsy-like immobility. 
No difference between these lines was revealed in the open field and social 
interaction tests. In the Morris water maze test, both lines effectively found 
the platform on the fourth day; however B6.CBA-D13Mit76B mice achieved 
significantly better results than cataleptic-prone animals. B6.CBA-D13Mit76C 
mice were characterized by decreased volume of the total brain and reduced sizes 
of striatum, cerebellum and pituitary gland. The both lines showed the similar 
basal and stress-induced levels of corticosterone, while the brain expression of 
Bdnf and Arc genes was more vulnerable to stress in the catalepsy-prone 
B6.CBA-D13Mit76C line.

Evaluating social defeat as a model for psychopathology in adult female rodents.

Solomon MB(1).

Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio.

Social conflict is a predominant stressor in humans and is associated with 
increased risk for developing psychological illnesses including depression and 
anxiety. Overwhelmingly, more women suffer from these disorders, which may be 
due to increased stress sensitivity. Like humans, rodents experience a myriad of 
physiological and behavioral sequelae due to prolonged stress exposure. Although 
the motivation for social conflict may differ between humans and rodents, female 
rodents may provide an opportunity to explore the underlying mechanisms by which 
stress confers risk for psychopathology in women. Because most female rodents do 
not express spontaneous aggression, the majority of basic research examines the 
physiological and behavioral outcomes of social conflict in male rodents. 
However, there are instances where female rodents exhibit territorial 
(California mice and Syrian hamsters) and maternal aggression (rats, mice, and 
hamsters) creating a venue to examine sex differences in physiology and behavior 
in response to stress. While many studies rely upon nonsocial behavioral assays 
(e.g., elevated plus maze, forced swim test) to assess the impact of stress on 
emotionality, here we primarily focus on behavioral outcomes in social-based 
assays in rodents. This is critically important given that disruptions in social 
relationships can be a cause and consequence of neuropsychiatric diseases. Next, 
we briefly discuss how sex differences in the recruitment of neural circuitry 
and/or neurochemistry in response to stress may underlie sex differences in 
neuroendocrine and behavioral stress responses. Finally, the translational value 
of females in rodent stress models and considerations regarding behavioral 
interpretations of these models are discussed. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

There is currently a lack of understanding how genetic background and sex 
differences attribute to the heterogeneity of obsessive-compulsive disorder 
(OCD). An animal model of compulsive-like behaviors has been developed through 
bidirectional selection of house mice (Mus musculus) for high (big cotton nests; 
BIG mice) and low levels (small nests; SMALL mice) of nest-building behavior. 
The BIG male strains have predictive and face validity as a spontaneous animal 
model of OCD. Here, we evaluated compulsive-, anxiety-, cognitive-, and 
depression-like behaviors among male and proestrus female replicate strains each 
of BIG (BIG1, BIG2) and SMALL (SML1, SML2) nest-builders, and randomly-bred 
Controls (C1, C2). BIG1 and BIG2 males and females had higher nesting scores 
when compared to SMALL and Control strains. Male BIG1 and BIG2 strains showed 
more compulsive-like nesting than BIG1 and BIG2 proestrus females, which was not 
observed among the other strains. Nesting scores were also different between BIG 
replicate male strains. A similar pattern was observed in the compulsive-like 
marble burying behavior with BIG strains burying more marbles than SMALL and 
Control strains. Significant replicate and sex differences were also observed in 
marble burying among the BIG strains. The open field test revealed replicate 
effects while the BIG strains showed less anxiety-like behavior in the elevated 
plus maze test compared to the SMALL strains. For novel object recognition only 
the Control strains showed replicate and sex differences. In the depression-like 
forced swim test proestrus females demonstrated less depression-like behavior 
than males. BIG and SMALL nest-building strains had a higher corticosterone 
stress response than the Control strains. Together these results indicate a 
strong interplay of genetic background and sex in influencing expression of 
behaviors in our compulsive-like mouse model. These results are in congruence 
with the clinical heterogeneity of OCD.

It has been proposed that depression is associated with dysfunction of 
hippocampal plasticity. Novel hypotheses suggest that antidepressants induce 
neuronal structural plasticity, although the underlying mechanisms still remain 
unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 
amitriptyline on levels of phosphorylated heavy neurofilament subunit (NF-H) in 
the hippocampus of mice exposed to acute and chronic behavioral despair 
paradigms. Immunoblotting experiments showed that animals exposed to the tail 
suspension test (TST) displayed diminished levels of pNF-H 24h after testing. 
Repeated administration of amitriptyline (10mg/kg i.p.) prevented this decreased 
hippocampal phosphorylation of NF-H. Conversely, administration of citalopram 
(10mg/kg i.p.) left unchanged pNF-H levels. The expression of pNF-H was also 
analyzed by immunofluorescence in mice exposed to the unpredictable chronic mild 
stress paradigm (UCMS), an experimental model of depression. Mice that developed 
a depressive-like behavior showed a decreased pNF-H immunostaining selectively 
in the hippocampal CA3 region. Chronic administration of amitriptyline reversed 
the despaired behavior induced by exposure to UCMS paradigm and, fully recovered 
pNF-H labeling to control values. Our results indicate that the cytoskeletal 
remodeling induced by amitriptyline in the hippocampal CA3 region might underpin 
its behavioral efficacy. Hippocampal alterations of the NF appeared associated 
with the mechanism of this antidepressant drug and may contribute to its 
psychotherapeutic actions.

Molecular mechanisms of depression-like pathophysiology in female rodent models 
are less reported compared to males, despite its higher prevalence in human 
females. Moreover, the stress-response in brain circuitries including reward and 
cognition circuitries varies with age or hormonal status of the females. So, to 
understand the stress-induced mood and cognitive disorders in intact females 
(with ovaries) and ovariectomized (OVX) females, we studied changes in mouse 
hippocampus, a functionally heterogeneous neural structure involved in both 
affective and cognitive behaviors. Here, we used a 6-day Chronic Unpredictable 
Stress (CUS) paradigm in mice to induce depression and related mood disorders. 
Interestingly, intact females and OVX females showed difference in mood disorder 
sub-phenotypes to CUS. Similar to an earlier report of CUS affecting the 
critical reward circuitry structure the nucleus accumbens differently in females 
with and without ovaries, cognitive behavior in intact females and OVX females 
also responded differentially to CUS, as evident from Morris Water Maze (MWM) 
test results. We report that the presence or absence of ovarian hormones, 
particularly the estrogen, has a significant impact in altering the hippocampus 
related spatial memory and affective behavior, in females. Our results also 
illustrate that estrogen administration improves both reward and cognitive 
behavior, and plays a significant role in alleviating stress-induced despair 
behavior and enhancing spatial reference memory following a brief 6-day 
stressful paradigm. Further, it also indicates that the NMDA receptor subunits, 
GRIN2A and GRIN2B, might mediate the effects of estrogen in the hippocampal 
functions, thus suggestive of a translational significance of the finding.

BACKGROUND: Similar to the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine, 
the metabotropic glutamate 2/3 receptor antagonist, MGS0039, shows 
antidepressant effects. However, there are no reports comparing these 2 
compounds in the social defeat stress model of depression.
METHODS: We examined the effects of MGS0039 (1 mg/kg) and ketamine (10 mg/kg) on 
depression-like behavior in susceptible mice after repeated social defeat 
stress. Protein levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, TrkB, phospho-TrkB, 
α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (GluA1), 
postsynaptic density protein 95, and dendritic spine density in selected brain 
regions were measured.
RESULTS: In the tail suspension and forced swimming tests, both MGS0039 and 
ketamine significantly attenuated the increased immobility time observed in 
susceptible mice, compared with vehicle-treated animals, 1 or 2 days after a 
single dose of drug. In the sucrose preference test, both compounds 
significantly improved the reduced preference typically seen in susceptible mice 
at 3 to 7 days after a single dose of drug. Western-blot analyses showed that 
similar to ketamine, MGS0039 significantly attenuated the reduced brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor, phospho-TrkB/TrkB ratio, GluA1 and postsynaptic density 
protein 95 seen in the prefrontal cortex, dentate gyrus, and CA3 of the 
hippocampus from susceptible mice, 8 days after a single dose. Again, in a 
similar manner to ketamine, MGS0039 significantly attenuated the reduction of 
spine density in the prelimbic regions of the medial prefrontal cortex, dentate 
gyrus, and CA3 of the hippocampus, but not infralimbic regions of the medial 
prefrontal cortex and CA1, in susceptible mice 8 days after a single dose. In 
contrast, neither drug elicited an effect on altered brain-derived neurotrophic 
factor-TrkB signaling, GluA1, and postsynaptic density protein 95 levels and did 
not increase spine density observed in the nucleus accumbens of susceptible 
mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Similar to ketamine, MGS0039 shows rapid and sustained 
antidepressant effects in the social defeat stress model. Long-lasting 
synaptogenesis in the prelimbic regions of medial prefrontal cortex, dentate 
gyrus, and CA3 might be implicated in this sustained antidepressant effect.

Postpartum depression (PPD) has adverse effects on offspring and increases their 
vulnerability to psychiatric disorders such as depression. Akt-mTOR signaling in 
the hippocampus is implicated in depression but its role in the behavioral 
deficits in PPD offspring remains unknown. By using a prepregnancy stress model 
of PPD in which Balb/c females that experience chronic stress before pregnancy 
show long-lasting PPD-like behaviors, we tested depression-like behaviors in PPD 
offspring (PPD-F1) at juvenile and adult ages as well as in the second 
generation (PPD-F2) produced by cross of male PPD-F1 with naïve females. 
Hippocampal Akt-mTOR signaling was examined in the F1 and F2 generations of PPD, 
as well as in PPD-F1 mice treated with a single dose of the antidepressant 
ketamine. PPD-F1 showed depression-like behaviors at juvenile and adult stages, 
evidenced by reduced sucrose preference (SP), increased immobility time in the 
forced swim test (FST), and a longer latency to feed and reduced food 
consumption in the novelty suppressed feeding (NSF) test. PPD-F1 mice showed 
Akt-mTOR signaling deficiency in the hippocampus, with down-regulated expression 
of p-Akt, p-mTOR and p-p70S6K. A single dose of ketamine reversed the behavior 
deficits and the impairment in Akt-mTOR signaling in PPD-F1. Furthermore, the 
PPD-F2 mice remained deficient in the SP and NSF test and hippocampal Akt-mTOR 
signaling, although the performance in FST was normal. The present study 
demonstrated both long-term and transgenerational effects of PPD on the 
depression-like behaviors of offspring, and suggested impaired Akt-mTOR 
signaling may play a part.

Chrysin is a flavonoid which is found in bee propolis, honey and various plants. 
Antidepressant-like effect of chrysin in chronically stressed mice was 
previously demonstrated by our group. Conversely, neurochemical factors 
associated with this effect require further investigations. Thus, we 
investigated the possible involvement of pro-inflammatory cytokines, kynurenine 
pathway (KP), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) metabolism and caspases activities in 
the effect of chrysin in mice exposed to unpredictable chronic stress (UCS). UCS 
applied for 28 days induced a depressive-like behavior, characterized by 
decrease in the time of grooming in the splash test and by increase in the 
immobility time in the tail suspension test. Oral treatment with chrysin (5 or 
20mg/kg, 28 days), similarly to fluoxetine (10mg/kg, positive control), 
culminated in the prevention of these alterations. UCS elevated plasma levels of 
corticotropin-releasing hormone and adrenocorticotropic hormone, as well the 
tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6 and kynurenine levels in 
the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HP). UCS induced the decrease in 
the 5-HT levels in the HP and the increase in the indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase, 
caspase 3 and 9 activities in the PFC and HP. Treatment with chrysin, similarly 
to fluoxetine, promoted the attenuation of these alterations occasioned by UCS. 
These results corroborated with the antidepressant potential of chrysin in the 
treatment of psychiatric diseases. Furthermore, this work indicated the 
association of pro-inflammatory cytokines synthesis, KP, 5-HT metabolism and 
caspases activities with the action exercised by chrysin in mice exposed to UCS.

Comparison of fluoxetine and 1-methyl-L-tryptophan in treatment of 
depression-like illness in Bacillus Calmette-Guerin-induced inflammatory model 
of depression in mice.

Rana P, Sharma AK, Jain S, Deshmukh P, Bhattacharya SK, Banerjee BD, Mediratta 
PK.

BACKGROUND: The inflammatory response system has been implicated in the 
pathophysiology of major depression. The pro-inflammatory cytokines like 
interferon-γ induce the enzyme indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) of the 
kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism. The induction of IDO reduces the 
availability of tryptophan for serotonin synthesis. Furthermore, the metabolites 
of kynurenine pathway have neurotoxic property, which along with decreased 
serotonin may account for depression-like illness.
METHODS: The aim of this study was to compare the effects of treatment with 
fluoxetine and 1-methyl-L-tryptophan (1-MT) on Bacillus Calmette-Guerin 
(BCG)-induced inflammatory model of depression in mice. Behavioral tests 
included locomotor activity, forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test 
(TST). Oxidative stress was assessed by examining the levels of thiobarbituric 
acid reactive species (TBARS) and non-protein thiols (NP-SH) in homogenized 
whole brain samples. Comet assays were performed to assess neurotoxicity.
RESULTS: The results of this study demonstrate that BCG treatment resulted in an 
increase in duration of immobility in FST and TST as compared to the saline 
group. Further, it produced a significant increase in the brain TBARS levels and 
decrease in the brain NP-SH levels. The hippocampal tissue from BCG group had 
significantly more comet cells than the saline group. 1-MT and fluoxetine were 
able to reverse the BCG-induced depression-like behavior and the derangement in 
oxidative stress parameters. Fluoxetine and 1-MT also reversed the BCG-induced 
neurotoxicity in such mice.
CONCLUSIONS: 1-Methyl-L-tryptophan exhibits antidepressant-like effect 
comparable to that of fluoxetine in treating BCG-induced depression-like 
behavior in mice.

Agmatine is an endogenous neuromodulator that has been shown to have 
antidepressant-like properties. We have previously demonstrated that it can 
induce a rapid increase in BDNF levels after acute administration, suggesting 
that agmatine may be a fast-acting antidepressant. To investigate this 
hypothesis, the present study evaluated the effects of a single administration 
of agmatine in mice subjected to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS), a model of 
depression responsive only to chronic treatment with conventional 
antidepressants. The ability of agmatine to reverse CUS-induced behavioral and 
biochemical alterations was evaluated and compared with those elicited by the 
fast-acting antidepressant (ketamine) and the conventional antidepressant 
(fluoxetine). After exposed to CUS for 14days, mice received a single oral dose 
of agmatine (0.1mg/kg), ketamine (1mg/kg) or fluoxetine (10mg/kg), and were 
submitted to behavioral evaluation after 24h. The exposure to CUS caused an 
increased immobility time in the tail suspension test (TST) but did not change 
anhedonic-related parameters in the splash test. Our findings provided evidence 
that, similarly to ketamine, agmatine is able to reverse CUS-induced 
depressive-like behavior in the TST. Western blot analyses of prefrontal cortex 
(PFC) demonstrated that mice exposed to CUS and/or treated with agmatine, 
fluoxetine or ketamine did not present alterations in the immunocontent of 
synaptic proteins [i.e. GluA1, postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) and 
synapsin]. Altogether, our findings indicate that a single administration of 
agmatine is able to reverse behavioral alterations induced by CUS in the TST, 
suggesting that this compound may have fast-acting antidepressant-like 
properties. However, there was no alteration in the levels of synaptic proteins 
in the PFC, a result that need to be further investigated in other time points.

Major depressive disorder is disease with high rate of morbidity and mortality. 
Stressful events lead to depression and they can be used as a model of 
depression in rodents. In this study we aimed to investigate whether lithium 
modifies the stressed-induced depression through blockade of opioid receptors in 
mice. We used foot shock stress as stressor and forced swimming test (FST), tail 
suspension test (TST) and open field test (OFT) to evaluation the behavioral 
responses in mice. We also used naltrexone hydrochloride (as opioid receptor 
antagonist), and morphine (as opioid receptor agonist). Our results displayed 
that foot-shock stress significantly increased the immobility time in TST and 
FST but it could not change the locomotor behavior in OFT. When we combined the 
low concentrations of lithium and naltrexone a significant reduction in 
immobility time was seen in the FST and TST in comparison with control 
foot-shock stressed group administered saline only. Despite the fact that our 
data showed low concentrations of lithium, when administered independently did 
not significantly affect the immobility time. Also our data indicated that 
concurrent administration of lithium and naltrexone had no effect on open field 
test. Further we demonstrated that simultaneous administration of morphine and 
lithium reverses the antidepressant like effect of active doses of lithium. Our 
data acclaimed that we lithium can augment stressed-induced depression and 
opioid pathways are involved in this action.

The N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor channel is involved in various 
physiological functions, including learning and memory. The GluN2D subunit of 
the NMDA receptor has low expression in the mature brain, and its role is not 
fully understood. In the present study, the effects of GluN2D subunit deficiency 
on emotional and cognitive function were investigated in GluN2D knockout (KO) 
mice. We found a reduction of motility (i.e., a depressive-like state) in the 
tail suspension test and a reduction of sucrose preference (i.e., an anhedonic 
state) in GluN2D KO mice that were group-housed with littermates. Despite 
apparently normal olfactory function and social interaction, GluN2D KO mice 
exhibited a decrease in preference for social novelty, suggesting a deficit in 
social recognition or memory. Golgi-Cox staining revealed a reduction of the 
complexity of dendritic trees in the accessory olfactory bulb in GluN2D KO mice, 
suggesting a deficit in pheromone processing pathway activation, which modulates 
social recognition. The deficit in social recognition may result in social 
stress in GluN2D KO mice. Isolation housing is a procedure that has been shown 
to reduce stress in mice. Interestingly, 3-week isolation and treatment with 
agomelatine or the 5-hydroxytryptamine-2C (5-HT2C) receptor antagonist SB242084 
reversed the anhedonic-like state in GluN2D KO mice. In contrast, treatment with 
the 5-HT2C receptor agonist CP809101 induced depressive- and anhedonic-like 
states in isolated GluN2D KO mice. These results suggest that social stress that 
is caused by a deficit in social recognition desensitizes 5-HT2c receptors, 
followed by an anhedonic- and depressive-like state, in GluN2D KO mice. The 
GluN2D subunit of the NMDA receptor appears to be important for the recognition 
of individuals and development of normal emotionality in mice. 5-HT2C receptor 
antagonism may be a therapeutic target for treating social stress-induced 
anhedonia. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 'Ionotropic 
glutamate receptors'.

PURPOSE: The effects of creatine and exercise on chronic stress-induced 
depression are unclear. In the present study, we identified the effects of 
4-week supplementation of creatine monohydrate and/or exercise on antidepressant 
behavior and raphe 5-HT expression in a chronic mild stress-induced depressed 
mouse model.
METHODS: Seven-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (n=48) were divided randomly into 5 
groups: (1) non-stress control (CON, n=10), (2) stress control (ST-CON, n=10), 
(3) stress and creatine intake (ST-Cr, n=10), (4) stress and exercise (ST-Ex, 
n=9), and (5) combined stress, exercise, and creatine intake (ST-Cr+Ex, n=9). 
After five weeks' treatment, we investigated using both anti-behavior tests (the 
Tail Suspension Test (TST) and the Forced Swimming Test (FST)), and 5-HT 
expression in the raphe nuclei (the dorsal raphe (DR) and median raphe (MnR)).
RESULTS: Stress for 4 weeks significantly increased depressive behaviors in the 
mice. Treatment with creatine supplementation combined with exercise 
significantly decreased depressive behaviors as compared with the CON-ST group 
in both the TST and FST tests. With stress, 5-HT expression in the raphe nuclei 
decreased significantly. With combined creatine and exercise, 5-HT positive 
cells increased significantly and had a synergic effect on both DR and MnR.
CONCLUSION: The present study found that even a single treatment of creatine or 
exercise has partial effects as an antidepressant in mice with chronic mild 
stress-induced depression. Furthermore, combined creatine and exercise has 
synergic effects and is a more effective prescription than a single treatment.

High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) has been implicated as a key factor in several 
neuroinflammatory conditions. Our previous study suggested that the release of 
central HMGB1 acts as a late-phase mediator in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced 
depression. Recent findings indicate that the redox state of HMGB1 is a critical 
determinant of its immunomodulatory properties. Here, we aimed to investigate 
the potential mechanisms that link the redox states of HMGB1 to depression in 
mice. Distinct redox forms of recombinant HMGB1 (rHMGB1) were used that included 
fully reduced HMGB (fr-HMGB1), which acted as a chemokine, and disulfide-HMGB1 
(ds-HMGB1), which possessed cytokine activity. Fr-HMGB1 in vivo was partially 
oxidized into ds-HMGB1; thus, the mutant protein non-oxidizable chemokine-HMGB 
(nonoxid-HMGB1) was applied. Concurrent with depressive behavior induced by 
four-week stress exposure, the HMGB1 concentrations in the serum and cerebral 
cortex substantially increased. Therefore, a single dose of rHMGB1 
(200ng/5μl/mice) or vehicle was administered to mice via intracerebroventricular 
(i.c.v.) injection. The receptor inhibitors of TLR4/RAGE/CXCR4 
(TAK-242/FPS-ZM1/AMD3100) (3mg/kg) were intraperitoneally injected 30min prior 
to rHMGB1 treatment. Depressive-like behavior was measured 20h post i.c.v. 
injection. Administration of fr-HMGB1 prolonged the immobility duration in the 
tail suspension test (TST) and decreased sucrose preference. In addition to 
depressive behavior, the hippocampal TNF-α protein slightly increased. These 
depressive behaviors and upregulation of hippocampal TNF-α were alleviated or 
abrogated by pretreatment with the inhibitors AMD3100, FPS-ZM1, and TAK-242. 
Alternatively, nonoxid-HMGB1 failed to induce TNF-α protein or prolong the 
immobility duration. As expected, ds-HMGB1 administration substantially 
upregulated hippocampal TNF-α protein, increased the immobility time in the TST 
and decreased sucrose preference. Moreover, both glycyrrhizin and TAK-242 
improved ds-HMGB1-induced depressive behavior. Furthermore, TAK-242 
significantly blocked the upregulation of hippocampal TNF-α protein and 
protected hippocampal myelin basic protein from ds-HMGB1-induced reduction. 
These drugs had no effect on the total or central distance in the open field 
test. Collectively, this initial experiment demonstrates the role and receptor 
mechanisms of HMGB1 under different redox states on the induction of 
depressive-like behavior. Both ds-HMGB1 and fr-HMGB1 may induce depressive-like 
behavior in vivo mainly via neuroinflammatory response activation.

The tachykinin NK1 receptor was suggested to be involved in psychiatric 
disorders, but its antagonists have failed to be effective as antidepressants in 
clinical trials. Hemokinin-1 (HK-1), the newest tachykinin, is present in 
several brain regions and activates the NK1 receptor similarly to substance P 
(SP), but acts also through other mechanisms. Therefore, we investigated the 
roles of the Tac4 gene-derived HK-1 in comparison with SP and neurokinin A (NKA) 
encoded by the Tac1 gene, as well as the NK1 receptor in anxiety and 
depression-like behaviors in mice. Mice lacking SP/NKA, HK-1 or the NK1 receptor 
(Tac1-/-, Tac4-/-, Tacr1-/-, respectively) compared to C57Bl/6 wildtypes (WT), 
and treatment with the NK1 antagonist CP99994 were used in the experiments. 
Anxiety was evaluated in the light-dark box (LDB) and the elevated plus maze 
(EPM), locomotor activity in the open field (OFT) tests. Hedonic behavior was 
assessed in the sucrose preference test (SPT), depression-like behavior in the 
tail suspension (TST) and forced swim (FST) tests. FST-induced neuronal 
responsiveness was evaluated with Fos immunohistochemistry in several 
stress-related brain regions. In the LDB, Tac4-/- mice spent significantly less, 
while Tacr1-/- and CP99994-treated mice spent significantly more time in the lit 
compartment. In the EPM only Tac4-/- showed reduced time in the open arms, but 
no difference was observed in any other groups. In the OFT Tac4-/- mice showed 
significantly reduced, while Tac1-/- and Tacr1-/- animals increased motility 
than the WTs, but CP99994 had no effect. NK1-/- consumed markedly more, while 
Tac4-/- less sucrose solution compared to WTs. In the TST and FST, Tac4-/- mice 
showed significantly increased immobility. However, depression-like behavior was 
decreased both in cases of genetic deletion and pharmacological blockade of the 
NK1 receptor. FST-induced neuronal activation in different nuclei involved in 
behavioral and neuroendocrine stress responses was significantly reduced in the 
brain of Tac4 -/- mice. Our results provide the first evidence for an anxiolytic 
and anti-depressant-like actions of HK-1 through a presently unknown 
target-mediated mechanism. Identification of its receptor and/or signaling 
pathways might open new perspectives for anxiolytic and anti-depressant 
therapies.

Dermatosis often as a chronic disease requires effective long-term treatment; a 
comprehensive evaluation of mental health of dermatology drug does not receive 
enough attention. An interaction between dermatology and psychiatry has been 
increasingly described. Substantial evidence has accumulated that psychological 
stress can be associated with pigmentation, endocrine and immune systems in skin 
to create the optimal responses against pathogens and other physicochemical 
stressors to maintain or restore internal homeostasis. Additionally, given the 
common ectodermal origin shared by the brain and skin, we are interested in 
assessing how disruption of skin systems (pigmentary, endocrine and immune 
systems) may play a key role in brain functions. Thus, we selected three drugs 
(hydroquinone, isotretinoin, tacrolimus) with percutaneous excessive delivery to 
respectively intervene in these systems and then evaluate the potential 
neurotoxic effects. Firstly, C57BL/6 mice were administrated a dermal dose of 
hydroquinone cream, isotretinoin gel or tacrolimus ointment (2%, 0.05%, 0.1%, 
respectively, 5 times of the clinical dose). Behavioral testing was performed 
and levels of proteins were measured in the hippocampus. It was found that mice 
treated with isotretinoin or tacrolimus, presented a lower activity in 
open-field test and obvious depressive-like behavior in tail suspension test. 
Besides, they damaged cytoarchitecture, reduced the level of 5-HT-5-HT1A/1B 
system and increased the expression of apoptosis-related proteins in the 
hippocampus. To enable sensitive monitoring the dose-response characteristics of 
the consecutive neurobehavioral disorders, mice received gradient concentrations 
of hydroquinone (2%, 4%, 6%). Subsequently, hydroquinone induced behavioral 
disorders and hippocampal dysfunction in a dose-dependent response. When doses 
were high as 6% which was 3 times higher than 2% dose, then 100% of mice 
exhibited depressive-like behavior. Certainly, 6% hydroquinone exposure elicited 
the most serious impairment of hippocampal structure and survival. The fact that 
higher doses of hydroquinone are associated with a greater risk of depression is 
further indication that hydroquinone is responsible for the development of 
depression. These above data demonstrated that chronic administration of 
different dermatology drugs contributed into common mental distress. This 
surprising discovery of chemical stressors stimulating the hippocampal 
dysfunction, paves the way for exciting areas of study on the cross-talk between 
the skin and the brain, as well as is suggesting how to develop effective and 
safe usage of dermatological drugs in daily practice.

BACKGROUND: We are interested in the causal interactions between psychological 
stress and activity within different compartments of the immune system. 
Psychosocial stress has been reported to not only alter microglia morphology but 
also produce anxiety-like and depressive-like effects by triggering CNS 
infiltration of macrophages from the periphery. We sought to test these 
phenomena in a somewhat different but standardized model of chronic social 
defeat (SD) stress.
METHODS: We used a paradigm of dyadic home pairing of dominant and subordinate 
mice that has been validated to induce powerful anxiety-like and depressive-like 
effects manifested by behavior assessed in social tasks. We administered the SD 
stress for 3 days (acute SD) or 14 days (chronic SD) and looked for monocyte 
entry into the brain by three independent means, including CD45 activation 
states assessed by flow cytometry and tracking fluorescently tagged peripheral 
cells from Ccr2 (wt/rfp) and Ubc (gfp/gfp) reporter mice. We further 
characterized the effects of SD stress on microglia using quantitative 
morphometric analysis, ex vivo phagocytosis assays, flow cytometry, and 
immunochemistry.
RESULTS: We saw no evidence of stress-induced macrophage entry after acute or 
chronic defeat stress. In comparison, brain infiltration of peripheral cells did 
occur after endotoxin administration. Furthermore, mutant mice lacking 
infiltrating macrophages due to CCR2 knockout developed the same degree of 
chronic SD-induced depressive behavior as wildtype mice. We therefore focused 
more closely on the intrinsic immune cells, the microglia. Using Cx3cr1 (wt/gpf) 
microglial reporter mice, we saw by quantitative methods that microglial 
morphology was not altered by stress at either time point. However, chronic SD 
mice had elevated numbers of CD68(hi) microglia examined by flow cytometry. CD68 
is a marker for phagocytic activity. Indeed, these cells ex vivo showed elevated 
phagocytosis, confirming the increased activation status of chronic SD 
microglia. Finally, acute SD but not chronic SD increased microglial 
proliferation, which occurred selectively in telencephalic stress-related brain 
areas.
CONCLUSIONS: In the SD paradigm, changes in CNS-resident microglia numbers and 
activation states might represent the main immunological component of the 
psychosocial stress-induced depressive state.

Perinatal development represents a critical period in the life of an individual. 
A common cause of poor development is that which comes from undernutrition or 
malnutrition. In particular, protein deprivation during development has been 
shown to have deep deleterious effects on brain's growth and plasticity. 
Early-life stress has also been linked with an increased risk to develop 
different psychopathologies later in life. We have previously shown that 
perinatal protein malnutrition in mice leads to the appearance of 
anxiety-related behaviors in the adulthood. We also found evidence that the 
female offspring was more susceptible to the development of depression-related 
behaviors. In the present work, we further investigated this behavior together 
with its molecular bases. We focused our study on the hippocampus, as it is a 
structure involved in coping with stressful situations. We found an increase in 
immobility time in the forced swimming test in perinatally malnourished females, 
and an alteration in the expression of genes related with neuroplasticity, early 
growth response 1, calcineurin and c-fos. We also found that perinatal 
malnutrition causes a reduction in the number of neurons in the hippocampus. 
This reduction, together with altered gene expression, could be related to the 
increment in immobility time observed in the forced swimming test.

chronic unpredictable mild stress in mice.

Bilobalide (BB), a unique constituent of Ginkgo biloba, has powerful 
neuroprotection and stress-alleviating properties. However, whether BB exerts a 
positive effect on depression and cognitive deficit induced by chronic stress is 
not known. The present study was designed to investigate the influence of BB on 
depression and cognitive impairments induced by chronic unpredictable mild 
stress (CUMS) in mice. During daily exposure to stressors for 5 consecutive 
weeks, mice were administered BB at the doses of 0, 3, or 6 mg/kg/day 
intraperitoneally. We replicated the finding that CUMS induced depression-like 
behavior and cognitive deficits as the CUMS+vehicle (VEH) group showed a 
significant increase in immobility in the tail suspension test, a decrease in 
the discrimination index of the novel object recognition task, and increased 
latency to platform and decreased number of platform crossings in the Morris 
water maze compared with the control+VEH group. Chronic administration of BB 
effectively reversed these alterations. In addition, the CUMS+VEH group showed 
significantly higher levels of baseline serum corticosterone than those of the 
control+VEH group and BB dose-dependently inhibited this effect. Our results 
suggest that BB may be useful for inhibition of depression-like behavior and 
cognitive deficits, and this protective effect was possibly exerted partly 
through an action on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

OBJECTIVES: Obesity is a chronic disease frequently associated with serious 
co-morbidities, such as diabetes type II, metabolic syndrome, and psychiatric 
disorders. Little is known, however, regarding the behavioral consequences of 
modified diet constituents and the propensity to development of stress related 
disorders. Thus, the aim of this study was to verify whether chronic exposure to 
a normocaloric/high-carbohydrate diet will modify the animal's behavior after 
different stressful stimuli.
METHODS: BALB/c mice were fed for 12 weeks with a standard chow diet or high 
refined carbohydrate-containing diet (HC). Following this period, independent 
groups of animals were exposed to different stress paradigms: 1 - two hours of 
restraint stress followed by exposure to the Elevated Plus Maze test (EPM) 24 
hours later; 2 - The contextual fear conditioning (CFC) test and 3 - the tail 
suspension test (TST).
RESULTS: Despite no change on total body weight, animals fed with HC diet showed 
increase in serum leptin levels and higher adiposity compared to diet control 
group. In behavioral tests, animals from HC diet group displayed reduction in 
the percentage of entries into the open arms of the EPM, evaluated 24 hours 
after restraint stress, suggesting an anxiogenic-like effect. It is also 
observed increase in aversive memory in the CFC test and depressive-like 
behavior in TST.
DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that a moderate obesity, induced by high refined 
carbohydrate diet, may facilitate the development of anxiety and depressive-like 
behaviors after the stress. The mechanisms responsible for such effects remain 
to be elucidated.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: An efficacious antidepressant without unwanted 
side effects is need urgently at present. This study aimed to investigate 
whether treatment with four Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs), namely Radix 
Astragali, Saposhnikovia divaricate (SD), Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. bark (EU), and 
Corydalis yanhusuo W. T. Wang (C. yanhusuo), could reverse the effects of 
chronic mild stress (CMS) in a depression-like mouse model and the potential 
mechanism(s) of their action.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vitro study, the proliferation of NSCs was assessed 
using the MTS assay. In vivo study, chronic mild stress (CMS) was used in mice 
for 14 days to establish a depression-like mouse model. Plasma corticosterone 
levels were assessed by UPLC coupled to a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer. 
The forced swim test (FST) was used to assess the effects of the four CHMs on 
depression. BrdU incorporation and TUNEL staining were used to assay hippocampal 
precursor cell proliferation rate and apoptosis.
RESULTS: The CHMs included Radix Astragali, EU, C. yanhusuo, and SD were shown 
to promote neuroproliferation in vitro. In vivo study, oral administration of 
these four CHMs for 14 days reversed the elevated plasma corticosterone levels, 
body weight loss, decrease in proliferation of hippocampal precursor cells; they 
also inhibited hippocampal cell apoptosis, and exhibited an antidepressant-like 
effect in a depression-like mouse model induced by CMS.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that each of these CHMs has the potential to 
ameliorate depression. The possible mechanisms of action include modulation of 
the HPA axis, reduction in stress hormone levels, inhibition of apoptosis, and 
promotion of hippocampal neuronal plasticity and neurogenesis.

The present study aimed to examine the antidepressant-like effects and the 
possible mechanisms of Schisandra chinensis on depressive-like behavior induced 
by repeated corticosterone injections in mice. Here we evaluated the effect of 
an ethanol extract of the dried fruit of S. chinensis (EESC) on BDNF/TrkB/CREB 
signaling in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. Three weeks of 
corticosterone injections in mice resulted in depressive-like behavior, as 
indicated by the significant decrease in sucrose consumption and increase the 
immobility time in the forced swim test, but without any influence on the 
locomotor activity. Further, there was a significant increase in serum 
corticosterone level and a significant downregulation of BDNF/TrkB/CREB 
signaling pathway in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in CORT-treated mice. 
Treatment of mice with EESC (600mg/kg) significantly ameliorated all the 
behavioral and biochemical changes induced by corticosterone. Moreover, 
pharmacological inhibition of BDNF signaling by K252a abolished entirely the 
antidepressant-like effect triggered by chronic EESC treatment. These results 
suggest that EESC produces an antidepressant-like effect in CORT-induced 
depression in mice, which is possibly mediated, at least in part, by rectifying 
the stress-based hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction paradigm 
and upregulation of BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling pathway.

Psychosocial adversity in early life increases the likelihood of mental and 
physical illness, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Mgat5 is 
an N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase in the Golgi pathway that remodels the 
N-glycans of glycoproteins at the cell surface. Mice lacking Mgat5 display 
conditional phenotypes in behaviour, immunity, metabolism, aging and cancer 
susceptibility. Here we investigated potential gene-environment interactions 
between Mgat5 and early life adversity on behaviour and physiological measures 
of physical health. Mgat5(-/-) mutant and Mgat5(+/+) wild-type C57Bl/6 
littermates were subject to maternal separation or foster rearing as an early 
life stressor, in comparison to control mice reared normally. We found an 
interaction between Mgat5 genotype and maternal rearing condition in which 
Mgat5(-/-) mice subjected to early life stress had lower glucose levels and 
higher bone density. Mgat5(-/-) genotype was also associated with less 
immobility in the forced swim test and greater sucrose consumption, consistent 
with a less depression-like phenotype. Cortical neuron dendrite spine density 
and branching was altered by Mgat5 deletion as well. In general, Mgat5 genotype 
affects both behaviour and physical outcomes in response to early life stress, 
suggesting some shared pathways for both in this model. These results provide a 
starting point for studying the mechanisms by which protein N-glycosylation 
mediates the effects of early life adversity.

Sildenafil is a highly effective oral agent for the treatment of erectile 
dysfunction of multiple etiologies. Although in clinical practice sildenafil is 
often used in depressed patients, its influence on the pathophysiology of 
depression remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the 
antidepressant-like activity following acute and subchronic treatment with 
sildenafil in naïve mice as well as in mice with reserpine- and restraint 
stress-induced depressive-like behavior. Since corticosterone is released in 
response to acute stress, we also aimed to assess the influence of sildenafil on 
serum corticosterone level in non-stressed and stressed animals. The 
antidepressant activity of sildenafil was assessed in the forced swim test. 
Corticosterone serum level was determined by using ELISA method, while brain and 
serum sildenafil level via HPLC method. Sildenafil administered acutely exerted 
an antidepressant-like effect. Subchronic (14 days) administration of sildenafil 
resulted only in a weak antidepressant-like effect when evaluated 24 h after the 
last dose. Acute but not subchronic sildenafil administration reversed the 
reserpine- and stress-induced immobility in the forced swim test. The lack of 
effects of sildenafil after subchronic treatment could have been related to its 
complete elimination from the brain within 24 h from the last injection. 
Interestingly, acute administration of sildenafil produced a marked increase in 
serum corticosterone level in both non-stressed and stressed animals. Sildenafil 
exerts differential effects in the forced swim test after acute and subchronic 
administration. Further studies on the antidepressant activity of sildenafil are 
required.

The adult brain is capable of adapting to internal and external stressors by 
undergoing structural plasticity, and failure to be resilient and preserve 
normal structure and function is likely to contribute to depression and anxiety 
disorders. Although the hippocampus has provided the gateway for understanding 
stress effects on the brain, less is known about the amygdala, a key brain area 
involved in the neural circuitry of fear and anxiety. Here, in mice more 
vulnerable to stressors, we demonstrate structural plasticity within the medial 
and basolateral regions of the amygdala in response to prolonged 21-day chronic 
restraint stress (CRS). Three days before the end of CRS, treatment with the 
putative, rapidly acting antidepressant, acetyl-l-carnitine (LAC) in the 
drinking water opposed the direction of these changes. Behaviorally, the LAC 
treatment during the last part of CRS enhanced resilience, opposing the effects 
of CRS, as shown by an increased social interaction and reduced passive behavior 
in a forced swim test. Furthermore, CRS mice treated with LAC show resilience of 
the CRS-induced structural remodeling of medial amygdala (MeA) stellate neurons. 
Within the basolateral amygdala (BLA), LAC did not reduce, but slightly 
enhanced, the CRS-increased length and number of intersections of pyramidal 
neurons. No structural changes were observed in MeA bipolar neurons, BLA 
stellate neurons or in lateral amygdala stellate neurons. Our findings identify 
MeA stellate neurons as an important component in the responses to stress and 
LAC action and show that LAC can promote structural plasticity of the MeA. This 
may be useful as a model for increasing resilience to stressors in at-risk 
populations.

Mother-infant interactions are known to be associated with the psychological 
well-being of an individual in adulthood. It is well accepted that emotional 
stress in early life, such as maternal separation (MS), leads to alterations in 
the neurotransmission systems of various brain regions, especially the 
mesolimbic dopaminergic system, and subsequently can increase the risk for 
development of psychiatric disorders including depression in adulthood. 
Selegiline is an irreversible monoamine oxidase (MAO) type B inhibitor which 
increases striatal dopamine levels and exerts an antidepressant effect. In this 
study, 180min of MS stress was applied to mice at postnatal day (PND) 2-14 
followed by behavioral tests for determining depressive-like behaviors, such as 
forced swimming test (FST), splash test and sucrose preference test (SPT) in 
adult mice (PND 50). The open field test (OFT) also was applied to validate FST 
results. We used SCH23390 (D1 antagonist) and sulpiride (D2 antagonist) in order 
to determine the role of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors in antidepressant-like 
effects of selegiline. Our results revealed that MS provoked depressive-like 
behaviors in adult male mice, and the administration of selegiline attenuated 
depressive-like behaviors in MS mice. Our findings showed that D1 dopamine 
receptors facilitate the positive effects of selegiline on the passive behavior 
in the FST. Furthermore, antidepressant effects of selegiline on hedonic 
difficulties are mediated via D2 receptor in the SPT. The results of the splash 
test revealed that both D1 and D2 receptors mediate the protective effect of 
selegiline against motivational and self-care problems. Based on our results, we 
conclude that both D1 and D2 dopamine receptors are involved in mediating the 
antidepressant-like effect of selegiline. We found that D1 receptors mediate an 
effect on despair behavior, D2 receptors mediate an effect on anhedonia, and 
both D1 and D2 receptors contribute to the protective effects of selegiline on 
motivational complications.

[Resistance of DBA/2J Mice to the Chronic Social Defeat Stress].

[Article in Russian]

Vishnivetskaya GB, Avgustinovich DF, Kudryavtseva NN.

We investigated behavioral changes in male mice DBA/2J after the acquisition of 
a long experience of social defeats in agonistic interactions with aggressive 
partners of C57BL/6J and DBA/2J lines. The long experience of social defeat in 
DBA/2J mice did not change the strategy of theirbehavi6r during agonistic 
interactions. Reduced communicativeness and increased level of anxiety were 
found in the "partition" and "elevated plus maze" tests. There were no changes 
in locomotor activity in the "open field" test. After 20-30 days of social 
defeat stress there were no signs of depression, determined by the behavior 
during confrontations and in the Porsolt test. There was no sign of catalepsy, 
decreased exploratory be- havior and impaired social recognition. Thus, the mice 
of this strain can be considered relatively resis- tant to the development of 
depressive-like state under chronic social stress and may be used for the study 
of the mechanisms of such stability.

Exposure to stressful life events plays a central role in the development of 
mood disorders in vulnerable individuals. However, the mechanisms that link mood 
disorders to stress are poorly understood. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor 
(BDNF) has long been implicated in positive regulation of depression and 
anxiety, while its precursor (proBDNF) recently showed an opposing effect on 
such mental illnesses. P75(NTR) and sortilin are co-receptors of proBDNF, 
however, the role of these receptors in mood regulation is not established. 
Here, we aimed to investigate the role of sortilin in regulating mood-related 
behaviors and its role in the proBDNF-mediated mood abnormality in mice. We 
found that sortilin was up-regulated in neocortex (by 78.3%) and hippocampus (by 
111%) of chronically stressed mice as assessed by western blot analysis. These 
changes were associated with decreased mobility in the open field test and 
increased depression-like behavior in the forced swimming test. We also found 
that sortilin deficiency in mice resulted in hyperlocomotion in the open field 
test and increased anxiety-like behavior in both the open field and elevated 
plus maze tests. No depression-like behavior in the forced swimming test and no 
deficit in spatial cognition in the Morris water maze test were found in the 
Sort1-deficient mice. Moreover, the intracellular and extracellular levels of 
mature BDNF and proBDNF were not changed when sortilin was absent in vivo and in 
vitro. Finally, we found that both WT and Sort1-deficient mice injected with 
proBDNF in lateral ventricle displayed increased depression-like behavior in the 
forced swimming test but not anxiety-like behaviors in the open field and 
elevated plus maze tests. The present study suggests that sortilin functions as 
a negative regulator of mood performance and can be a therapeutic target for the 
treatment of mental illness.

Major depression is a common long-lasting or recurrent psychiatric disease with 
high lifetime prevalence and high incidence of suicide. The main purpose of the 
current study was to verify whether liquiritigenin conferred an 
antidepressant-like effect on the depressive mouse model established by 
unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) and explore its possible mechanism. The 
results of depression-related behaviors including sucrose preference test (SPT), 
open field test (OFT), forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST) 
indicated that both liquiritigenin (7.5mg/kg, 15mg/kg) and fluoxetine (20mg/kg) 
dramatically improved the depression symptoms. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) revealed that treatment with liquiritigenin significantly reduced the 
concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β 
and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in serum and hippocampus. Compared with the 
UCMS group, the administrations of liquiritigenin, increased levels of 
superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), and decreased 
Malondialdehyde (MDA) content. Meanwhile, glucocorticoids (GC) content was 
reduced in the liquiritigenin group, which suggested that liquiritigenin 
exhibiting the ameliorative effect on activated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal 
(HPA) axis stimulated with UCMS. Mice treated with liquiritigenin showed 
restored levels of neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT). 
Western blot analysis displayed up-regulated expressions of 
p-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), p-Akt, p- mammalian target of rapamycin 
(mTOR), p-tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB), brain-derived neurotrophic factor 
(BDNF). Thus, it was supposed that liquiritigenin might be useful for the 
treatment of chronic depression possibly through PI3K/Akt/mTOR mediated 
BDNF/TrkB pathway.

BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder is associated with disturbed circadian 
rhythms. To investigate the causal relationship between mood disorders and 
circadian clock disruption, previous studies in animal models have employed 
light/dark manipulations, global mutations of clock genes, or brain area 
lesions. However, light can impact mood by noncircadian mechanisms; clock genes 
have pleiotropic, clock-independent functions; and brain lesions not only 
disrupt cellular circadian rhythms but also destroy cells and eliminate 
important neuronal connections, including light reception pathways. Thus, a 
definitive causal role for functioning circadian clocks in mood regulation has 
not been established.
METHODS: We stereotactically injected viral vectors encoding short hairpin RNA 
to knock down expression of the essential clock gene Bmal1 into the brain's 
master circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).
RESULTS: In these SCN-specific Bmal1-knockdown (SCN-Bmal1-KD) mice, circadian 
rhythms were greatly attenuated in the SCN, while the mice were maintained in a 
standard light/dark cycle, SCN neurons remained intact, and neuronal connections 
were undisturbed, including photic inputs. In the learned helplessness paradigm, 
the SCN-Bmal1-KD mice were slower to escape, even before exposure to inescapable 
stress. They also spent more time immobile in the tail suspension test and less 
time in the lighted section of a light/dark box. The SCN-Bmal1-KD mice also 
showed greater weight gain, an abnormal circadian pattern of corticosterone, and 
an attenuated increase of corticosterone in response to stress.
CONCLUSIONS: Disrupting SCN circadian rhythms is sufficient to cause 
helplessness, behavioral despair, and anxiety-like behavior in mice, 
establishing SCN-Bmal1-KD mice as a new animal model of depression.

Our group has recently provided novel insights into a poorly understood 
component of intercommunication between the brain and the immune system by 
showing that psychological stress can modify lymphocytes in a manner that may 
boost resilience to psychological stress. To demonstrate the influence of the 
adaptive immune system on mood states, we previously showed that cells from 
lymph nodes of socially defeated mice, but not from unstressed mice, conferred 
anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects and elevated hippocampal cell 
proliferation when transferred into naïve lymphopenic Rag2(-/-) mice. In the 
present study, we asked whether similar transfer could be anxiolytic and 
antidepressant when done in animals that had been rendered anxious and depressed 
by chronic psychological stress. First, we demonstrated that lymphopenic 
Rag2(-/-) mice and their wild-type C57BL/6 mouse counterparts had similar levels 
of affect normally. Second, we found that following chronic (14days) restraint 
stress, both groups displayed an anxious and depressive-like phenotype and 
decreased hippocampal cell proliferation. Third, we showed that behavior in the 
open field test and light/dark box was normalized in the restraint-stressed 
Rag2(-/-) mice following adoptive transfer of lymph node cells from green 
fluorescent protein (GFP) expressing donor mice previously exposed to chronic 
(14days) of social defeat stress. Cells transferred from unstressed donor mice 
had no effect on behavior. Immunolabeling of GFP+ cells confirmed that tissue 
engraftment had occurred at 14days after transfer. We found GFP+ lymphocytes in 
the spleen, lymph nodes, blood, choroid plexus, and meninges of the recipient 
Rag2(-/-) mice. The findings suggest that the adaptive immune system may play a 
key role in promoting recovery from chronic stress. The data support using 
lymphocytes as a novel therapeutic target for anxiety states.

Anxiety, depression, and altered memory are associated with intestinal diseases, 
including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Understanding the link between these 
behavioral changes and IBD is important clinically since concomitant mood 
disorders often increase a patient's risk of requiring surgery and developing 
secondary functional gastrointestinal diseases. Anxiety-like behavior 
(light/dark box test) and recognition memory (novel object recognition task) 
were determined at the peak and during resolution of inflammation in the dextran 
sodium sulfate (DSS) mouse model of acute colitis. DSS (5 days) was administered 
via drinking water followed by 3 or 9 days of normal drinking water to assess 
behavior during active or resolving inflammation, respectively. Disease (weight, 
colon length, and histology) was assessed and the composition of the gut 
microbiota was characterized by using qPCR on fecal pellet DNA. In a subset of 
mice, pretreatment with probiotics was started 1 wk prior to commencing DSS. 
During active inflammation (8 days), mice demonstrated impaired recognition 
memory and exhibited anxiety-like behavior vs.
CONTROLS: These behavioral defects were normalized by 14 days post-DSS. Shifts 
in the composition of the gut microbiota were evident during active 
inflammation, notably as decreases in lactobacilli and segmented filamentous 
bacteria, which were also reversed once the disease had resolved. Administration 
of probiotics could prevent the behavioral defects seen in acute DSS. Taken 
together, our findings indicate that changes in mood and behavior are present 
during acute inflammation in murine IBD and associated with dysbiosis and that 
these outcomes can be prevented by the administration of probiotics.

Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) elicits aspects of cognitive and 
behavioral alterations that can be used to model comparable aspects of 
depression in humans. The aim of the present study was to investigate the 
antidepressant-like potential of 7-fluoro-1,3-diphenylisoquinoline-1-amine 
(FDPI), a novel isoquinoline compound, in CUMS, a model that meets face, 
construct and predictive criteria for validity. Swiss mice were subjected to 
different stress paradigms daily for a period of 35 days to induce the 
depressive-like behavior. The animals received concomitant FDPI (0.1 and 1mg/kg, 
intragastric) or paroxetine (8mg/kg, intraperitoneal) and CUMS. The behavioral 
tests (splash test, tail suspension test, modified forced swimming test and 
locomotor activity) were performed. The levels of cytokines, corticosterone and 
adrenocorticotropic (ACTH) hormones were determined in the mouse prefrontal 
cortex and serum. The synaptosomal [(3)H] serotonin (5-HT) uptake, nuclear 
factor (NF)-κB, tyrosine kinase receptor (TrkB) and pro-brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels were determined in the mouse prefrontal 
cortex. CUMS induced a depressive-like behavior in mice, which was demonstrated 
in the modified forced swimming, tail suspension and splash tests. FDPI at both 
doses prevented depressive-like behavior induced by CUMS, without altering the 
locomotor activity of mice. FDPI at the highest dose prevented the increase in 
the levels of NF-kB, pro-inflammatory cytokines, corticosterone and ACTH and 
modulated [(3)H]5-HT uptake and the proBDNF/TrkB signaling pathway altered by 
CUMS. The present findings demonstrated that FDPI elicited an 
antidepressant-like effect in a model of stress-induced depression.

Opioid and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors mediate different effects of 
fluoxetine. We investigated whether opioid and NMDA receptors are involved in 
the protective effect of fluoxetine against the behavioral despair induced by 
acute physical stress in male mice. We used the forced swimming test (FST), tail 
suspension test (TST), and open-field test (OFT) for behavioral evaluation. We 
used fluoxetine, naltrexone (opioid receptor antagonist), MK-801 (NMDA receptor 
antagonist), morphine (opioid receptor agonist), and NMDA (NMDA receptor 
agonist). Acute foot-shock stress (FSS) significantly induced behavioral despair 
(depressive-like) and anxiety-like behaviors in tests. Fluoxetine (5 mg/kg) 
reversed the depressant-like effect of FSS, but it did not alter the locomotion 
and anxiety-like behavior in animals. Acute administration of subeffective doses 
of naltrexone (0.3 mg/kg) or MK-801 (0.01 mg/kg) potentiated the 
antidepressant-like effect of fluoxetine, while subeffective doses of morphine 
(1 mg/kg) and NMDA (75 mg/kg) abolished this effect of fluoxetine. Also, 
co-administration of subeffective doses of naltrexone (0.05 mg/kg) and MK-801 
(0.003 mg/kg) with fluoxetine (1 mg/kg) induced a significant decrease in the 
immobility time in FST and TST. Our results showed that opioid and NMDA 
receptors (alone or in combination) are involved in the antidepressant-like 
effect of fluoxetine against physical stress.

Depression is a common psychopathological disorders. Studies of depression have 
indicated that zinc play a role in the depression pathophysiology and treatment. 
In present study, we examined the effects of zinc and imipramine supplement 
alone or combination of zinc and imipramine in mice induced by chronic restraint 
stress (CRS). Moreover, the possible roles of zinc receptor (G protein-coupled 
receptor 39, GPR39)-related pathway was investigated. Decreased weight and 
increased corticosterone (CORT) were observed after 3 weeks CRS exposure. It was 
shown that CRS induced lower serum zinc, higher hippocampal zinc, increased 
immobility time in tail suspension test and decreased movement distance in 
spontaneous activity test, which could be normalized by zinc (30 mg/kg) and 
imipramine (20 mg/kg) supplement alone and combination of zinc (15 mg/kg) and 
imipramine (5 mg/kg) for 3 weeks after CRS exposure. Moreover, the changes in 
mRNA expressions of GPR39, cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB), 
brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and n-methytl-d-aspartate receptors 
(NMDAR) could be reversed by the same treatment mentioned above. These results 
suggested that zinc dyshomeostasis in serum and hippocampus and depression-like 
behavior in CRS exposure animals observed in present study could be normalized 
by zinc and imipramine. The combination of zinc and imipramine in low dose has 
synergetic effects. The possible mechanism might be correlated to GPR39 
receptor-related pathway.

Advanced societies face increased health problems related to various stresses. 
Chronic psychological stress is a major risk factor for psychiatric disorders 
such as depression. Although therapeutic agents reduce several symptoms of 
depression, most have side effects in a broad range of the population. 
Furthermore, some victims of depression do not show significant improvement with 
any drugs, so alternative approaches are needed. Good dietary habits may 
potentially reduce depressive symptoms, but there is little scientific evidence 
thus far. Murine depression models are useful to test nutritional approaches in 
vivo. Our model mice subjected to a subchronic mild social defeat stress (sCSDS) 
paradigm show several alterations in physiological parameters and social 
behavior. These stress-induced symptoms in sCSDS mice can be used as cues to 
identify antidepressant-like natural resources including foods and farm 
products. We previously discovered that sCSDS mice show more vulnerability to 
social stress by changing dietary condition. In addition, we developed a more 
objective system for analyzing mouse behavior using a 3D depth-sensing camera to 
understand relationships between diet and behavior. The combination of sCSDS 
mice with 3D behavioral analysis is a powerful method for screening ingredients 
in foods and farm products for antidepressant-like effects.

Dexras1 is a novel GTPase that acts at a confluence of signaling mechanisms 
associated with psychiatric and neurological disease including NMDA receptors, 
NOS1AP and nNOS. Recent work has shown that Dexras1 mediates iron trafficking 
and NMDA-dependent neurodegeneration but a role for Dexras1 in normal brain 
function or psychiatric disease has not been studied. To test for such a role, 
mice with germline knockout (KO) of Dexras1 were assayed for behavioral 
abnormalities as well as changes in NMDA receptor subunit protein expression. 
Because Dexras1 is up-regulated during stress or by dexamethasone treatment, we 
included measures associated with emotion including anxiety and depression. 
Baseline anxiety-like measures (open field and zero maze) were not altered, nor 
were depression-like behavior (tail suspension). Measures of memory function 
yielded mixed results, with no changes in episodic memory (novel object 
recognition) but a significant decrement on working memory (T-maze). 
Alternatively, there was an increase in pre-pulse inhibition (PPI), without 
concomitant changes in either startle amplitude or locomotor activity. PPI data 
are consistent with the direction of change seen following exposure to dopamine 
D2 antagonists. An examination of NMDA subunit expression levels revealed an 
increased expression of the NR2A subunit, contrary to previous studies 
demonstrating down-regulation of the receptor following antipsychotic exposure 
(Schmitt et al., 2003) and up-regulation after exposure to isolation rearing 
(Turnock-Jones et al., 2009). These findings suggest a potential role for 
Dexras1 in modulating a selective subset of psychiatric symptoms, possibly via 
its interaction with NMDARs and/or other disease-related binding-partners. 
Furthermore, data suggest that modulating Dexras1 activity has contrasting 
effects on emotional, sensory and cognitive domains.

BACKGROUND: Stress plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of 
neuropsychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression. Beta vulgaris is 
commonly known as "beet root" possessing antioxidant, anticancer, 
hepatoprotective, nephroprotective, wound healing, and anti-inflammatory 
properties.
OBJECTIVE: To study the protective effect of Beta vulgaris Linn. ethanolic 
extract (BVEE) of leaves against acute restraint stress (ARS)-induced anxiety- 
and depressive-like behavior and oxidative stress in mice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice (n = 6) were pretreated with BVEE (100 and 200 
mg/kg, p. o.) for 7 days and subjected to ARS for 6 h to induce behavioral and 
biochemical changes. Anxiety- and depressive-like behavior were measured by 
using different behavioral paradigms such as open field test (OFT), elevated 
plus maze (EPM), forced swim test (FST), and tail suspension test (TST) 40 min 
postARS. Brain homogenate was used to analyze oxidative stress parameters, that 
is, malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) level.
RESULTS: BVEE pretreatment significantly (P < 0.05) reversed the ARS-induced 
reduction in EPM parameters, that is, percentage entries and time spent in open 
arms and in OFT parameters, that is, line crossings, and rearings in mice. 
ARS-induced increase in the immobility time in FST and TST was attenuated 
significantly (P < 0.05) by BVEE pretreatment at both the dosage. An increase in 
MDA and depletion of GSH level postARS was prevented significantly (P < 0.05) 
with BVEE pretreatment at both the dosage (100 and 200 mg/kg).
CONCLUSION: BVEE exhibits anxiolytic and antidepressant activity in stressed 
mice along with good antioxidant property suggesting its therapeutic potential 
in the treatment of stress-related psychiatric disorders.

Stress is a major risk factor in the onset of several neuropsychiatric disorders 
including anxiety and depression. Although several studies have shown that 
social isolation stress during postweaning period induces behavioral and brain 
molecular changes, the effects of social isolation on behavior during adulthood 
have been less characterized. Aim of this work was to investigate the 
relationship between the behavioral alterations and brain molecular changes 
induced by chronic social isolation stress in adult male mice. Plasma 
corticosterone levels and adrenal glands weight were also analyzed. Socially 
isolated (SI) mice showed higher locomotor activity, spent less time in the open 
field center, and displayed higher immobility time in the tail suspension test 
compared to group-housed (GH) mice. SI mice exhibited reduced plasma 
corticosterone levels and reduced difference between right and left adrenal 
glands. SI showed lower mRNA levels of the BDNF-7 splice variant, c-Fos, Arc, 
and Egr-1 in both hippocampus and prefrontal cortex compared to GH mice. 
Finally, SI mice exhibited selectively reduced mGluR1 and mGluR2 levels in the 
prefrontal cortex. Altogether, these results suggest that anxious- and 
depressive-like behavior induced by social isolation stress correlates with 
reduction of several neuroplasticity-related genes in the hippocampus and 
prefrontal cortex of adult male mice.

Previously published reports have revealed the antidepressant-like effects of 
icariin in a chronic mild stress model of depression and in a social defeat 
stress model in mice. However, the therapeutic effect of icariin in an animal 
model of glucocorticoid-induced depression remains unclear. This study aimed to 
investigate antidepressant-like effect and the possible mechanisms of icariin in 
a rat model of corticosterone (CORT)-induced depression by using a combination 
of behavioral and biochemical assessments and NMR-based metabonomics. The 
depression model was established by subcutaneous injections of CORT for 21 
consecutive days in rats, as evidenced by reduced sucrose intake and hippocampal 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels, together with an increase in 
immobility time in a forced swim test (FST). Icariin significantly increased 
sucrose intake and hippocampal BDNF level and decreased the immobility time in 
FST in CORT-induced depressive rats, suggesting its potent antidepressant 
activity. Moreover, metabonomic analysis identified eight, five and three 
potential biomarkers associated with depression in serum, urine and brain tissue 
extract, respectively. These biomarkers are primarily involved in energy 
metabolism, lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism and gut microbe metabolism. 
Icariin reversed the pathological process of CORT-induced depression, partially 
via regulation of the disturbed metabolic pathways. These results provide 
important mechanistic insights into the protective effects of icariin against 
CORT-induced depression and metabolic dysfunction.

Women of child-bearing age are the population group at highest risk for 
depression. In pregnant women, fluoxetine (Flx) is the most widely prescribed 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) used for the treatment of 
depression. While maternal stress, depression, and Flx exposure have been shown 
to effect neurodevelopment of the offspring, separately, combined effects of 
maternal stress and Flx exposure have not been extensively examined. The present 
study investigated the effects of prenatal maternal stress and perinatal 
exposure to the SSRI Flx on the behavior of male mice as adults.
METHODS: C57BL/6 dams exposed to chronic unpredictable stress from embryonic (E) 
day 4 to E18 and non-stressed dams were administered Flx (25 mg/kg/d) in the 
drinking water from E15 to postnatal day 12. A separate control group consisted 
of animals that were not exposed to stress or Flx. At 12 days of age, brain 
levels of serotonin were assessed in the male offspring. At two months of age, 
the male offspring of mothers exposed to prenatal stress (PS), perinatal Flx, PS 
and Flx, or neither PS or Flx, went through a comprehensive behavioral test 
battery. At the end of testing brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) levels 
were assessed in the frontal cortex of the offspring.
RESULTS: Maternal behavior was not altered by either stress or Flx treatment. 
Treatment of the mother with Flx led to detectible Flx and NorFlx levels and 
lead to a decrease in serotonin levels in pup brains. In the adult male 
offspring, while perinatal exposure to Flx increased aggressive behavior, 
prenatal maternal stress decreased aggressive behavior. Interestingly, the 
combined effects of stress and Flx normalized aggressive behavior. Furthermore, 
perinatal Flx treatment led to a decrease in anxiety-like behavior in male 
offspring. PS led to hyperactivity and a decrease in BDNF levels in the frontal 
cortex regardless of Flx exposure. Neither maternal stress or Flx altered 
offspring performance in tests of cognitive abilities, memory, sensorimotor 
information processing, or risk assessment behaviors. These results demonstrate 
that maternal exposure to stress and Flx have a number of sustained effects on 
the male offspring.

In rodents, repeated exposure to unavoidable aggression followed by sustained 
sensory treat can lead to prolonged social aversion. The chronic social defeat 
stress model explores that phenomenon and it has been used as an animal model 
for human depression. However, some authors have questioned whether confounding 
effects may arise as the model also boosts anxiety-related behaviors. Despite 
its wide acceptance, most studies extract limited information from the behavior 
of the defeated animal. Often, the normalized occupancy around the social 
stimulus, the interaction zone, is taken as an index of depression. We 
hypothesized that this parameter is insufficient to fully characterize the 
behavioral consequences of this form of stress. Using an ethological approach, 
we showed that repeated social defeat delayed the expression of social 
investigation in long (10 min) sessions of social interaction. Also, the 
incidence of defensive behaviors, including stretched-attend posture and high 
speed retreats, was significantly higher in defeated mice in comparison to 
controls. Interestingly, a subpopulation of defeated mice showed recurrent and 
non-habituating stretched-attend posture and persistent flights during the 
entire session. Two indexes were created based on defensive behaviors to show 
that only recurrent flights correlates with sucrose intake. Together, the 
present study corroborates the idea that this model of social stress can 
precipitate a myriad of behaviors not readily disentangled. We propose that long 
sessions (>150 s) and detailed ethological evaluation during social interaction 
tests are necessary to provide enough information to correctly classify defeated 
animals in terms of resilience and susceptibility to social defeat stress.

AIMS: Sigma-1 receptors are involved in the pathophysiological process of 
several neuropsychiatric diseases such as epilepsy, depression. Allosteric 
modulation represents an important mechanism for receptor functional regulation. 
In this study, we examined antidepressant activity of the latest identified 
novel and selective allosteric modulator of sigma-1 receptor 3-methyl-phenyl-2, 
3, 4, 5-tetrahydro-1H-benzo[d]azepin-7-ol (SOMCL-668).
METHODS AND RESULTS: A single administration of SOMCL-668 decreased the 
immobility time in the forced swimming test (FST) and tailing suspended test in 
mice, which were abolished by pretreatment of sigma-1 receptor antagonist 
BD1047. In the chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS) model, chronic application 
of SOMCL-668 rapidly ameliorated anhedonia-like behavior (within a week), 
accompanying with the enhanced expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor 
(BDNF) and phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) (Ser-9) in the 
hippocampus. SOMCL-668 also rapidly promoted the phosphorylation of GSK3β 
(Ser-9) in an allosteric manner in vitro. In the cultured primary neurons, 
SOMCL-668 enhanced the sigma-1 receptor agonist-induced neurite outgrowth and 
the secretion of BDNF.
CONCLUSION: SOMCL-668, a novel allosteric modulator of sigma-1 receptors, 
elicits a potent and rapid acting antidepressant effect. The present data 
provide the first evidence that allosteric modulation of sigma-1 receptors may 
represent a new approach for antidepressant drug discovery.

Depression and anxiety involve hippocampal dysfunction, but the specific 
relationship between these mood disorders and adult hippocampal dentate gyrus 
neurogenesis remains unclear. In both humans with MDD and rodent models of 
depression, administration of antidepressants increases DG progenitor and 
granule cell number, yet rodents with induced ablation of DG neurogenesis 
typically do not demonstrate depressive- or anxiety-like behaviors. The 
conflicting data may be explained by the varied duration and degree to which 
adult neurogenesis is reduced in different rodent neurogenesis ablation models. 
In order to test this hypothesis we examined how a transient-rather than 
permanent-inducible reduction in neurogenesis would alter depressive- and 
anxiety-like behaviors. Transgenic Nestin-CreERT2/floxed diphtheria toxin 
fragment A (DTA) mice (Cre+DTA+) and littermates (Cre+DTA-; control) were given 
tamoxifen (TAM) to induce recombination and decrease nestin-expressing stem 
cells and their progeny. The decreased neurogenesis was transient: 12 days 
post-TAM Cre+DTA+ mice had fewer DG proliferating Ki67+ cells and fewer DCX+ 
neuroblasts/immature neurons relative to control, but 30 days post-TAM Cre+DTA+ 
mice had the same DCX+ cell number as control. This ability of DG neurogenesis 
to recover after partial ablation also correlated with changes in behavior. 
Relative to control, Cre+DTA+ mice tested between 12-30 days post-TAM displayed 
indices of a stress-induced anxiety phenotype-longer latency to consume highly 
palatable food in the unfamiliar cage in the novelty-induced hypophagia test, 
and a depression phenotype-longer time of immobility in the tail suspension 
test, but Cre+DTA+ mice tested after 30 days post-TAM did not. These findings 
suggest a functional association between adult neurogenesis and stress induced 
anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors, where induced reduction in DCX+ cells at 
the time of behavioral testing is coupled with stress-induced anxiety and a 
depressive phenotype, and recovery of DCX+ cell number corresponds to 
normalization of these behaviors.

BACKGROUND: The Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type R (PTPRR), which 
regulates the dephosphorylation of the downstream mitogen-activated protein 
kinase (MAPK) steering cell proliferation, apoptosis and synaptic plasticity, 
may be involved in the pathogenesis of depression.
METHODS: Lentiviral vectors were utilized to express the PTPRR constitutively in 
the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) of mice before or after chronic mild stress. 
Behavior tests, MAPK levels, neuronal apoptosis and cell proliferation in the 
hippocampal DG were examined.
RESULTS: Without chronic mild stress (CMS), the lenti-shPTPRR mice showed 
shorter immobility time in the tail suspension test than controls, while the 
lenti-PTPRR mice exhibited significantly less sucrose intake and increased 
immobility time in the forced swim tests than control mice, indicating increased 
prodepressant-like effects of PTPRR in lenti-PTPRR mice. Similarly, under CMS, 
the lenti-shPTPRR mice had more sucrose intake, shorter immobility time in the 
forced swim test and tail suspension test compared to controls, and lenti-PTPRR 
mice had less sucrose intake and longer immobility time in forced swim test and 
tail suspension test, exhibiting increased susceptibility to depressive-like 
behaviors and greater sensitivity to CMS. Besides, the Phospho-ERK1/2(p-ERK) had 
significant lower phosphorylation in lenti-PTPRR group and higher expression in 
lenti-shPTPRR group, both without CMS. The Lenti-PTPRR mice exposed to CMS had 
significant lower p-ERK, and the lenti-shPTPRR mice exposed to CMS had 
significant higher p-ERK and lower p-P38. Moreover, there were more cells 
underwent apoptosis in lenti-PTPRR group ,with and without CMS. In cell 
proliferation, less BrdU positive cells were observed in lenti-PTPRR mice than 
controls.
CONCLUSION: The site-speciﬁc lentiviral injections resulted in the PTPRR 
over-expression in the hippocampal DG and subsequent increased ERK 
dephosphorylation, which leads to more neuron apoptosis, less cell 
proliferation, depression onset and increased sensitivity to CMS. PTPRR/ERK 
pathway could be potential target for depression therapy.

Most psychiatric and neurological diseases are exacerbated by stress. Because 
this may partially result from stress-induced inflammation, we examined factors 
involved in this stress response. After a paradigm of inescapable foot shock 
stress that causes learned helplessness depression-like behavior, eighteen 
cytokines and chemokines increased in mouse hippocampus, peaking 6-12h after 
stress. A 24h prior pre-conditioning stress accelerated the rate of 
stress-induced hippocampal cytokine and chemokine increases, with most reaching 
peak levels after 1-3h, often without altering the maximal levels. Toll-like 
receptor 4 (TLR4) was involved in this response because most stress-induced 
hippocampal cytokines and chemokines were attenuated in TLR4 knockout mice. 
Stress activated glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) in wild-type mouse 
hippocampus, but not in TLR4 knockout mice. Administration of the antidepressant 
fluoxetine or the GSK3 inhibitor TDZD-8 reduced the stress-induced increases of 
most hippocampal cytokines and chemokines. Stress increased hippocampal levels 
of the danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) protein high mobility group 
box 1 (HMGB1), activated the inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB, and the 
NLRP3 inflammasome. Knockdown of HMGB1 blocked the acceleration of cytokine and 
chemokine increases in the hippocampus caused by two successive stresses. 
Fluoxetine treatment blocked stress-induced up-regulation of HMGB1 and 
subsequent NF-κB activation, whereas TDZD-8 administration attenuated NF-κB 
activation downstream of HMGB1. To test if stress-induced cytokines and 
chemokines contribute to depression-like behavior, the learned helplessness 
model was assessed. Antagonism of TNFα modestly reduced susceptibility to 
learned helplessness induction, whereas TLR4 knockout mice were resistant to 
learned helplessness. Thus, stress-induces a broad inflammatory response in 
mouse hippocampus that involves TLR4, GSK3, and downstream inflammatory 
signaling, and these stress responses contribute to susceptibility to 
depression-like behavior in mice.

Stress and excessive glutamatergic neurotransmission have been implicated in the 
pathophysiology of depression. Therefore, this study was aimed at investigating 
the influence of zinc on depressive-like behavior induced by chronic 
unpredictable stress (CUS), on alterations in glutamate-induced toxicity and 
immunocontent of proteins involved in the control of glutamatergic 
neurotransmission in the hippocampus of mice. Mice were subjected to CUS 
procedure for 14 days. From the 8th to the 14th day, mice received zinc chloride 
(ZnCl2) (10 mg/kg) or fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, positive control) once a day by oral 
route. CUS caused a depressive-like behavior evidenced by the increased 
immobility time in the tail suspension test (TST), which was prevented by 
treatment with ZnCl2 or fluoxetine. Ex vivo exposure of hippocampal slices to 
glutamate (10 mM) resulted in a significant decrease on cell viability; however, 
neither CUS procedure nor drug treatments altered this reduction. No alterations 
in the immunocontents of GLT-1 and GFAP or p-Akt were observed in any 
experimental group. The ratio of p-Akt/AKT was also not altered in any group. 
However, Akt immunocontent was increased in stressed mice and in animals treated 
with ZnCl2 (stressed or non-stressed mice) and EAAC1 immunocontent was increased 
in stressed mice treated with ZnCl2, fluoxetine or vehicle and in non-stressed 
mice treated with ZnCl2 and fluoxetine. These findings indicate a robust effect 
of zinc in reversing behavioral alteration induced by CUS in mice, through a 
possible modulation of the glutamatergic neurotransmission, extending literature 
data regarding the mechanisms underlying its antidepressant-like action.

Exposure to maternal separation (MS) during early life is an identified risk 
factor for emotional disorders such as anxiety and depression later in life. 
This study investigated the effects of neonatal MS on the behavior and long-term 
potentiation (LTP) as well as basic synaptic transmission at hippocampal CA3-CA1 
and mossy fiber (MF)-CA3 synapses in adolescent mice for 19days. When mice were 
adolescents, we measured depression, learning, memory, anxious and aggressive 
behavior using the forced swimming test (FST), Y-maze, Morris water maze (MWM), 
elevated plus maze (EPM), three consecutive days of the open field test, the 
social interaction test, the tube-dominance test and the resident-intruder test. 
The results showed that there was no difference in FST, Y-maze, and MWM 
performance. However, MS mice showed more anxiety-like behavior in the EPM test 
and aggressive-like behavior in the tube-dominance and resident-intruder tests. 
In addition, the magnitude of LTP and release probability in the MF-CA3 synapses 
was reduced in the MS group but not in the CA3-CA1 synapse. Our results indicate 
that early life stress due to MS may induce anxiety- and aggressive-like 
behavior during adolescence, and these effects are associated with synaptic 
plasticity at the hippocampal MF-CA3 synapses.

Depression and anxiety are disabling and highly prevalent psychiatric disorders. 
To better understand the neurobiological basis of mood and anxiety disorders, 
relevant animal models are needed. The corticosterone mouse model is frequently 
used to study depression. Chronic stress and accompanying glucocorticoid 
elevation causes pathological changes in the central nervous system, which are 
related to psychiatric symptoms. Exogenous administration of corticosterone is 
therefore often used to induce depressive-like behavior in mice and in some 
cases also features of anxiety-like behavior are shown. However, a thorough 
characterization of this model has never been conducted and housing conditions 
of the used subjects often differ between the implemented protocols. We 
chronically administered a subcutaneous corticosterone bolus injection to 
single- and group-housed mice, and we subsequently evaluated the face validity 
of this model by performing a battery of behavioral tests (forced swim test, 
mouse-tail suspension test, saccharin intake test, novelty-suppressed feeding 
test, elevated plus maze, light/dark paradigm and open field test). Our results 
show that corticosterone treatment has a substantial overall effect on 
depressive-like behavior. Increases in anxiety-like behavior on the other hand 
are mainly seen in single housed animals, independent of treatment. The current 
study therefore does not only show a detailed behavioral characterization of the 
corticosterone mouse model, but furthermore also elucidates the critical 
influence of housing conditions on the behavioral outcome in this model.

RATIONALE: In response to stress, corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) and 
vasopressin (AVP) are released from the hypothalamus, activate their receptors 
(CRHR1, CRHR2 or AVPr1b), and synergistically act to induce adrenocorticotropic 
hormone (ACTH) release from the anterior pituitary. Overstimulation of this 
system has been frequently associated with major depression states.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study is to assess the role of AVP and CRH 
receptors in fluoxetine and venlafaxine effects on the expression of 
depression-related behavior.
METHODS: In an animal model of depression (olfactory bulbectomy in mice, OB), we 
evaluated the effects of fluoxetine or venlafaxine (both 10 mg/kg/day) chronic 
administration on depression-related behavior in the tail suspension test. 
Plasma levels of AVP, CRH, and ACTH were determined as well as participation of 
their receptors in the expression of depression related-behavior and gene 
expression of AVP and CRH receptors (AVPr1b, CRHR1, and CRHR2) in the pituitary 
gland.
RESULTS: The expression of depressive-like behavior in OB animals was reversed 
by treatment with both antidepressants. Surprisingly, OB-saline mice exhibited 
increased AVP and ACTH plasma levels, with no alterations in CRH levels when 
compared to sham mice. Chronic fluoxetine or venlafaxine reversed these effects. 
In addition, a significant increase only in AVPr1b gene expression was found in 
OB-saline.
CONCLUSION: The antidepressant therapy used seems to be more likely related to a 
reduced activation of AVP rather than CRH receptors, since a positive 
correlation between AVP levels and depressive-like behavior was observed in OB 
animals. Furthermore, a full restoration of depressive behavior was observed in 
OB-fluoxetine- or venlafaxine-treated mice only when AVP was centrally 
administered but not CRH.

Victims of bullying often undergo depression, low self-esteem, high anxiety and 
post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. The social defeat model has become 
widely accepted for studying experimental animal behavior changes associated 
with bullying; however, differences in the effects in susceptible and 
unsusceptible individuals have not been well studied. The present study 
investigated the effects of social defeat stress on behavior and the expression 
of dopamine receptors D1 and D2 in the brains of adult mice. Adult mice were 
divided into susceptible and unsusceptible groups after 10days of social defeat 
stress. Behavioral tests were conducted, and protein levels in the brains were 
assessed by Western blotting. The results indicate that all mice undergo 
decreased locomotion and increased anxiety behavior. However, decreased social 
interaction and impaired memory performance were only observed in susceptible 
mice. A significantly decreased expression of D1 was observed in the prefrontal 
cortex and amygdala of susceptible mice only. No significant differences in D2 
expression were shown between control and defeated mice in any area studied. 
These data indicate that depression-like behavior and cognition impairment 
caused by social defeat stress in susceptible mice may be related to changes in 
the dopamine receptor D1.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) represent the most common 
treatment for major depression. However, their efficacy is variable and 
incomplete. In order to elucidate the cause of such incomplete efficacy, we 
explored the hypothesis positing that SSRIs may not affect mood per se but, by 
enhancing neural plasticity, render the individual more susceptible to the 
influence of the environment. Consequently, SSRI administration in a favorable 
environment promotes a reduction of symptoms, whereas in a stressful environment 
leads to a worse prognosis. To test such hypothesis, we exposed C57BL/6 mice to 
chronic stress in order to induce a depression-like phenotype and, subsequently, 
to fluoxetine treatment (21 days), while being exposed to either an enriched or 
a stressful condition. We measured the most commonly investigated molecular, 
cellular and behavioral endophenotypes of depression and SSRI outcome, including 
depression-like behavior, neurogenesis, brain-derived neurotrophic factor 
levels, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity and long-term potentiation. 
Results showed that, in line with our hypothesis, the endophenotypes 
investigated were affected by the treatment according to the quality of the 
living environment. In particular, mice treated with fluoxetine in an enriched 
condition overall improved their depression-like phenotype compared with 
controls, whereas those treated in a stressful condition showed a distinct 
worsening. Our findings suggest that the effects of SSRI on the depression- like 
phenotype is not determined by the drug per se but is induced by the drug and 
driven by the environment. These findings may be helpful to explain variable 
effects of SSRI found in clinical practice and to device strategies aimed at 
enhancing their efficacy by means of controlling environmental conditions.

Recent studies indicate multiple roles for integrin αvβ3 in adult neurons, 
including response to pharmacological agents such as cocaine and selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitors. In this study, we examined the role of the 
integrin β3 gene (Itgb3) in the response to environmental stimuli by subjecting 
Itgb3+/+ and Itgb3-/- mice to unpredictable chronic mild stressors. We found 
that genetic abrogation of integrin β3 expression elicits an exaggerated 
vulnerability to chronic unpredictable stress in the open field test. In this 
test, chronic stress elicited significant decreases in stereotypic behavior and 
horizontal locomotor activity, including increases in anxiety behaviors. Mild 
chronic stress led to reductions in dopamine turnover in midbrains of Itgb3+/+, 
but not Itgb3-/- mice, suggesting a disruption of stress-dependent regulation of 
DA homeostasis. Chronic stress elicited altered synaptic expression of syntaxin 
and synaptophysin in midbrains of Itgb3-/- mice, when compared to Itgb3+/+. 
Semi-quantitative Western blot studies revealed that the synaptic expression, 
but not total tissue expression, of multiple signaling proteins is correlated 
with integrin αv levels in the midbrain. Moreover, loss of integrin β3 
expression modifies this correlation network. Together, these findings 
demonstrate that Itgb3-/- mice display a pattern of changes indicating disrupted 
regulation of midbrain synaptic systems involved in conferring resilience to 
mild stressors.

Increasing evidence has shown that oxidative stress may be implicated in chronic 
stress-induced depression. Several flavonoids with anti-oxidative effects have 
been proved to be anti-depressive. Myricetin is a well-defined flavonoid with 
the anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and neuroprotective 
properties. The aim of the present study is to investigate the possible effects 
of chronic administration of myricetin on depressant-like behaviors in mice 
subjected to repeated restraint (4 h/day) for 21 days. Our results showed that 
myricetin administration specifically reduced the immobility time in mice 
exposed to chronic stress, as tested in both forced swimming test and tail 
suspension test. Myricetin treatment improved activities of glutathione 
peroxidase (GSH-PX) in the hippocampus of stressed mice. In addition, myricetin 
treatment decreased plasma corticosterone levels of those mice subjected to 
repeated restraint stress. The effects of myricetin on the brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in hippocampus were also investigated. The 
results revealed that myricetin normalized the decreased BDNF levels in mice 
subjected to repeated restraint stress. These findings provided more evidence 
that chronic administration of myricetin improves helpless behaviors. The 
protective effects of myricetin might be partially mediated by an influence on 
BDNF levels and might be attributed to myricetin-mediated anti-oxidative stress 
in the hippocampus.

Ingestion of specific probiotics, namely "psychobiotics", produces psychotropic 
effects on behavior and affects the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and 
neurochemicals in the brain. We examined the psychotropic effects of a potential 
psychobiotic bacterium, Lactobacillus plantarum strain PS128 (PS128), on mice 
subjected to early life stress (ELS) and on naïve adult mice. Behavioral tests 
revealed that chronic ingestion of PS128 increased the locomotor activities in 
both ELS and naïve adult mice in the open field test. In the elevated plus maze, 
PS128 significantly reduced the anxiety-like behaviors in naïve adult mice but 
not in the ELS mice; whereas the depression-like behaviors were reduced in ELS 
mice but not in naïve mice in forced swimming test and sucrose preference test. 
PS128 administration also reduced ELS-induced elevation of serum corticosterone 
under both basal and stressed states but had no effect on naïve mice. In 
addition, PS128 reduced inflammatory cytokine levels and increased 
anti-inflammatory cytokine level in the serum of ELS mice. Furthermore, the 
dopamine level in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) was significantly increased in 
PS128 treated ELS and naïve adult mice whereas serotonin (5-HT) level was 
increased only in the naïve adult mice. These results suggest that chronic 
ingestion of PS128 could ameliorate anxiety- and depression-like behaviors and 
modulate neurochemicals related to affective disorders. Thus PS128 shows 
psychotropic properties and has great potential for improving stress-related 
symptoms.

Several studies have shown that repeated stressful experiences during childhood 
increases the likelihood of developing depression- and anxiety-related disorders 
in adulthood; however, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We 
subjected drd3-EGFP and drd3-null mice to daily, two hour restraint stress 
episodes over a five day period during preadolescence (postnatal day 35 to 39), 
followed by social isolation. When these mice reached adulthood (post-natal day 
> 90), we assessed locomotor behavior in a novel environment, and assessed 
depression-related behavior in the Porsolt Forced Swim test. We also measured 
the expression and function of dopamine D3 receptor in limbic brain areas such 
as hippocampus, nucleus accumbens and amygdala in control and stressed drd3-EGFP 
mice in adulthood. Adult male mice subjected to restraint stress during 
preadolescence exhibited both anxiety- and depression-related behaviors; 
however, adult female mice subjected to preadolescent restraint stress exhibited 
only depression-related behaviors. The development of preadolescent 
stress-derived psychiatric disorders was blocked by D3 receptor selective 
antagonist, SB 277011-A, and absent in D3 receptor null mice. Adult male mice 
that experienced stress during preadolescence exhibited a loss of D3 receptor 
expression and function in the amygdala but not in hippocampus or nucleus 
accumbens. In contrast, adult female mice that experienced preadolescent stress 
exhibited increased D3 receptor expression in the nucleus accumbens but not in 
amygdala or hippocampus. Our results suggest that the dopamine D3 receptor is 
centrally involved in the etiology of adult anxiety- and depression-related 
behaviors that arise from repeated stressful experiences during childhood.

RATIONALE: Numerous studies have demonstrated that neuroinflammation is 
associated with depression-like symptoms and neuropsychological disturbances, 
and cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLT1R) was reported to be involved in 
neuroinflammation. The pathophysiological role of CysLT1R has been reported in 
several types of brain damage. However, the role of CysLT1R in depression 
remains to be elucidated.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the effect of hippocampal CysLT1R 
downregulation on depressive behaviors and neuroinflammatory responses in mice 
exposed to chronic mild stress (CMS).
RESULTS: We firstly found that expression of hippocampal CysLT1R was gradually 
increased over CMS exposure, while 3 weeks treatment with fluoxetine reversed 
the increment of hippocampal CysLT1R expression. Hippocampal CysLT1R knockdown 
suppressed CMS-induced depressive-like behaviors as evidenced by decreases in 
immobility time in tail suspension test (TST), decreased latency to feed in 
novelty-suppressed feeding (NSF) test, and by increase in the number of entries 
and decrease in time spent in the open arm in elevated plus maze (EPM) test. 
Increments of hippocampal NF-κB p65, IL-1β, and TNF-α induced by CMS were also 
prevented by hippocampal CysLT1R knockdown beforehand.
CONCLUSIONS: Hippocampal CysLT1R participates in depression, and knockdown of 
hippocampal CysLT1R prevents CMS-induced depressive-like behaviors and 
neuroinflammation, suggesting that suppression of CysLT1R could prevent the 
development of depression.

Behavioral and physiological evaluations of animal models of depression are 
essential to thoroughly understand the mechanisms of depression in humans. 
Various models have been developed and characterized, and the socially defeated 
mouse has been widely used for studying depression. Here, we developed and 
characterized a mouse model of social aversion using a subchronic and mild 
social defeat stress (sCSDS) paradigm. Compared to control mice, sCSDS mice 
showed significantly increased body weight gain, water intake, and social 
aversion to dominant mice on the social interaction test. We observed nest 
building behavior in sCSDS mice using the pressed cotton as a nest material. 
Although sCSDS mice eventually successfully built nests, the onset of nest 
building was severely delayed compared to control mice. The underlying mechanism 
of this significant delay in nest building by sCSDS mice is unclear. However, 
our results demonstrate that nest building evaluation is a simple and useful 
assay for understanding behavior in socially defeated mice and screening drugs

BACKGROUND: Plumbagin has been reported to be neuroprotective, so it might 
possess antidepressant activity. Therefore, the present study was designed to 
explore the antidepressant potential of plumbagin in unstressed and stressed 
mice.
METHODS: Depression-like behavior was induced in Swiss male albino mice by 
subjecting them to unpredictable mild stress daily for 21 successive days. 
Plumbagin (4, 8 and 16mg/kg, po) and imipramine (15mg/kg, po) were administered 
for 3 successive weeks to separate groups of unstressed and stressed mice. Tail 
suspension test and sucrose preference test were used to evaluate antidepressant 
effect of the drugs.
RESULTS: Highest dose (16mg/kg) of plumbagin and imipramine significantly 
decreased immobility period of unstressed and stressed mice in tail suspension 
test as compared to their respective controls. These drugs significantly 
restored the reduced sucrose preference (%) in stressed mice. The drugs did not 
significantly affect locomotor activity of mice. Antidepressant-like activity of 
plumbagin was found to be comparable to imipramine. Plumbagin and imipramine 
significantly inhibited brain MAO-A activity, decreased plasma nitrite, brain 
malondialdehyde and catalase levels; and increased reduced glutathione levels of 
unstressed and stressed mice. The drugs significantly reversed stress-induced 
increase in plasma corticosterone levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Antidepressant-like activity of plumbagin in unstressed and 
stressed mice might be through inhibition of brain MAO-A activity and 
improvement of antioxidant status. Reversal of stress-induced increase in plasma 
corticosterone levels might also be responsible for antidepressant-like activity 
of plumbagin in stressed mice.

BACKGROUND: AMPA receptors are highly expressed throughout the central nervous 
system and are suggested to be involved in mood regulation. Studies found 
changes in glutamate, its metabolites and receptors in patients with bipolar 
disorder (BPD) or major depression (MD) and in animal models of stress. 
Additional data suggest that the glutamatergic system and AMPA receptors 
specifically, have an important role in modulating the therapeutic effects of 
mood stabilizers. Further research on the role of AMPA receptors in mood 
regulation can be done using AMPAkines, positive modulators of AMPA receptors. 
AMPAkines have been studied for cognitive enhancement in neurodegenerative 
disorders and some were also examined in preclinical studies of mood disorders. 
In that context, the present study was designed to test the effects of the 
AMPAkine CX717 in a strain specific battery of tests for mania-like behaviors.
METHODS: Black Swiss male mice were sub-chronically treated with 5 different 
doses of CX717 or vehicle and tested in a battery of behavioral tests including 
spontaneous activity, sweet solution preference, resident-intruder, forced swim 
and amphetamine-induced hyperactivity.
RESULTS: Data show that CX717 doses of 30mg/kg and above, but not lower, reduce 
activity levels. Moreover, 45mg/kg and above reduce interactions in the 
resident-intruder test and ameliorate amphetamine-induced hyperactivity.
CONCLUSIONS: The results therefore show a partial effect of CX717 on manic-like 
behavior, somewhat similar to previously demonstrated effects of atypical 
antipsychotic drugs in this strain. It is therefore suggested that further work 
related to AMPAkines in the treatment of affective disorders might be warranted.

Our previous study indicated that 071031B, a novel potential serotonin and 
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, showed robust antidepressant activity in 
multiple depression models, and could simultaneously inhibit 5-HT and NE 
reuptake in vitro. The present study was to evaluate the effects of 071031B on 
monoamine system in vivo, by using pharmacological models, including 5-HTP 
induced head-twitch test, yohimbine toxicity potentiation test, and reserpine 
induced hypothermia test, and determining monoamine transmitter levels in 
reserpine induced monoamine depletion model or chronic unpredictable stress 
(CUS) model. Results in pharmacological models indicated that acute 
administration of 071031B at 5-20 mg/kg significantly enhanced 5-HTP induced 
head-twitch behavior, potentiated yohimbine induced lethal rate, and reversed 
reserpine induced hypothermia. Further monoamine assays demonstrated that acute 
or chronic administration of 071031B at 10 or 20 mg/kg increased 5-HT and/or NE 
levels in various brain regions in reserpine or CUS induced monoamine depletion 
models, respectively, without effect on DA and its metabolites. Our results 
revealed that 071031B produces potent inhibition of 5-HT and NE reuptake in 
vivo.

Morc1 gene has recently been identified by a DNA methylation and genome-wide 
association study as a candidate gene for major depressive disorder related to 
early life stress in rodents, primates and humans. So far, no transgenic animal 
model has been established to validate these findings on a behavioral level. In 
the present study, we examined the effects of a Morc1 loss of function mutation 
in female C57BL/6N mice on behavioral correlates of mood disorders like the 
Forced Swim Test, the Learned Helplessness Paradigm, O-Maze and Dark-Light-Box. 
We could show that Morc1(-/-) mice display increased depressive-like behavior 
whereas no behavioral abnormalities regarding locomotor activity or anxiety-like 
behavior were detectable. CORT plasma levels did not differ significantly 
between Morc1(-/-) mice and their wildtype littermates, yet - surprisingly - 
total Bdnf mRNA-levels in the hippocampus were up-regulated in Morc1(-/-) 
animals. Although further work would be clarifying, Morc1(-/-) mice seem to be a 
promising epigenetically validated mouse model for depression associated with 
early life stress.

Catalpol, a major compound in Rehmannia glutinosa with both medicinal and 
nutritional values, has been previously confirmed to shorten the duration of 
immobility in mice exposed to tail suspension and forced swimming tests. This 
study attempted to examine the anti-depressive mechanisms of catalpol in rats 
undergoing chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) by involving brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). CUMS-exposed rats were 
given catalpol daily (5, 10, and 20mg/kg, ig) or a reference drug, fluoxetine 
hydrochloride (FH, 10mg/kg, ig), at 5 weeks after starting the CUMS procedure. 
Sucrose preference test was performed to observe depression-like behavior, and 
serum and brain tissues were used for neurochemical and fluorescent quantitative 
reverse transcription PCR analysis. CUMS induced depression-like behavior, 
whereas catalpol and FH administration attenuated this symptom. Moreover, CUMS 
caused excessively elevated levels of serum corticosterone, an index of 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyperactivation, in a manner 
attenuated by catalpol and FH administration. Catalpol administration also 
further decreased BDNF activities, downregulated the mRNA expression of BDNF and 
tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB), and reversed the excessive elevation in the 
activities and mRNA expression levels of COX-2 and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in 
the hippocampus and frontal cortex of rats undergoing CUMS. Results indicate 
that catalpol can ameliorate CUMS-induced depression-like behavior, and suggest 
its mechanisms may partially be ascribed to restoring HPA axis dysfunctions, 
upregulating BDNF expression and its cognate receptor TrkB, and downregulating 
COX-2 expression, thereby reducing PGE2 levels in the brain.

Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a neuropeptide that has potent 
vasodilator properties and is involved in various behavioral disorders. The 
relationship between CGRP and depression-like behavior is unclear. In this 
study, we used chronically stressed mice to investigate whether CGRP is involved 
in depression-like behavior. Each mouse was exposed to restraint and water 
immersion stress for 15 days. After stress exposure, mice were assessed using 
behavioral tests: open field test, forced swim test and sucrose preference test. 
Serum corticosterone levels, hippocampal proliferation and mRNA expression of 
neurotrophins were measured. After stress exposure, mice exhibited 
depression-like behavior and decreased CGRP mRNA levels in the hippocampus. 
Although intracerebroventricular CGRP administration (0.5 nmol) did not alter 
depression-like behavior after 15-day stress exposure, a single CGRP 
administration into the brain, before the beginning of the 15-day stress 
exposure, normalized the behavioral dysfunctions and increased nerve growth 
factor (Ngf) mRNA levels in stressed mice. Furthermore, in the mouse E14 
hippocampal cell line, CGRP treatment induced increased expression of Ngf mRNA. 
The NGF receptor inhibitor K252a inhibited CGRP's antidepressant-like effects in 
stressed mice. These results suggest that CGRP expression in the mouse 
hippocampus is associated with depression-like behavior and changes in Ngf mRNA 
levels.

Recent findings indicate that fingolimod, the first oral drug approved for the 
treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS), acts as a direct inhibitor of histone 
deacetylases (HDACs) and enhances the production of brain-derived neurotrophic 
factor (BDNF) in the CNS. Both mechanisms are relevant to the pathophysiology 
and treatment of major depression. We examined the antidepressant activity of 
fingolimod in mice subjected to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS), a model of 
reactive depression endowed with face and pharmacological validity. Chronic 
treatment with fingolimod (3 mg kg(-1), i.p., once a day for 4 weeks) reduced 
the immobility time in the forced swim test (FST) in a large proportion of CUS 
mice. This treatment also caused anxiogenic-like effects in the social 
interaction test without affecting anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus 
maze or spatial learning in the water maze. CUS mice showed reduced BDNF levels 
and enhanced HDAC2 levels in the hippocampus. These changes were reversed by 
fingolimod exclusively in mice that showed a behavioral response to the drug in 
the FST. Fingolimod treatment also enhanced H3 histone K14-acetylation and adult 
neurogenesis in the hippocampus of CUS mice. Fingolimod did not affect most of 
the parameters we have tested in unstressed control mice. The 
antidepressant-like activity of fingolimod was confirmed in mice chronically 
treated with corticosterone. These findings show for the first time that 
fingolimod exerts antidepressant-like effect acting in a "disease-dependent" 
manner, and raise the interesting possibility that the drug could relieve 
depressive symptoms in MS patients independently of its disease-modifying effect 
on MS.

RATIONALE: The a2A-noradrenergic agonist guanfacine can decreases stress-induced 
smoking in female, but not male, human smokers. It is not known whether these 
effects are due to effects on mood regulation and/or result from 
nicotinic-cholinergic interactions.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to determine whether there are sex 
differences in the effect of guanfacine in tests of anxiolytic and 
antidepressant efficacy in mice at baseline and in a hypercholinergic model of 
depression induced by the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine.
METHODS: The effects of guanfacine were measured in the light/dark box, tail 
suspension, and the forced swim test in female and male C57BL/6J mice. In 
parallel, electrophysiological properties were evaluated in the prefrontal 
cortex, a critical brain region involved in stress responses. c-fos 
immunoreactivity was measured in other brain regions known to regulate mood.
RESULTS: Despite a baseline sex difference in behavior in the forced swim test 
(female mice were more immobile), guanfacine had similar, dose-dependent, 
antidepressant-like effects in mice of both sexes (optimal dose, 0.15 mg/kg). An 
antidepressant-like effect of guanfacine was also observed following 
pre-treatment with physostigmine. A sex difference in the paired-pulse ratio in 
the prefrontal cortex (PFC) (male, 1.4; female, 2.1) was observed at baseline 
that was normalized by guanfacine. Other brain areas involved in cholinergic 
control of depression-like behaviors, including the basolateral amygdala and 
lateral septum, showed sex-specific changes in c-fos expression.
CONCLUSIONS: Guanfacine has a robust antidepressant-like effect and can reverse 
a depression-like state induced by increased acetylcholine (ACh) signaling. 
These data suggest that different brain areas are recruited in female and male 
mice, despite similar behavioral responses to guanfacine.

Diabetes mellitus patients are at increased risk of developing depression, 
although the neurobiological bases of this comorbidity are not yet fully 
understood. These patients show CNS alterations, similar to those found in major 
depression, including changes in the structure and neurotransmission of 
excitatory neurons. However, although depressive patients and animal models also 
display alterations in inhibitory networks, little is known about the effects of 
diabetes on interneurons. Our main objective was to study the impact of diabetes 
on interneurons of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), one of the regions most 
affected by major depression. For this purpose we have induced diabetes with 
high-dose streptozotozin in transgenic mice displaying fluorescent interneurons. 
These animals showed a depressive-like behavior (increased immobility time in 
tail suspension test) in parallel with reductions in interneuronal dendritic 
arborization and in the expression of GAD67, the enzyme that synthetizes the 
inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. However, the levels of PSA-NCAM, a 
plasticity-related molecule exclusively expressed by interneurons in the mPFC, 
were unaltered in the different regions and layers of this cortical area. 
Interestingly, diabetic mice also showed increased levels of synaptophysin, a 
synaptic vesicle protein. These results indicate that the structure and 
neurotransmission of interneurons is altered in the mPFC of diabetic mice and 
suggest that these changes may play a key role in the depressive symptoms 
associated to diabetes.

Chronic stress is a potent risk factor for depression, but the mechanism by 
which stress causes depression is not fully understood. To investigate the 
molecular mechanism underlying stress-induced depression, C57BL/6 inbred mice 
were treated with repeated restraint to induce lasting depressive behavioral 
changes. Behavioral states of individual animals were evaluated using the forced 
swim test, which measures psychomotor withdrawals, and the U-field test, which 
measures sociability. From these behavioral analyses, individual mice that 
showed depression-like behaviors in both psychomotor withdrawal and sociability 
tests, and individuals that showed a resiliency to stress-induced depression in 
both tests were selected. Among the neuropeptides expressed in the amygdala, 
thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) was identified as being persistently 
up-regulated in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) in individuals exhibiting severe 
depressive behaviors in the two behavior tests, but not in individuals 
displaying a stress resiliency. Activation of TRH receptors by local injection 
of TRH in the BLA in normal mice produced depressive behaviors, mimicking 
chronic stress effects, whereas siRNA-mediated suppression of either TRH or 
TRHR1 in the BLA completely blocked stress-induced depressive symptoms. The 
TRHR1 agonist, taltirelin, injection in the BLA increased the level of p-ERK, 
which mimicked the increased p-ERK level in the BLA that was induced by 
treatment with repeated stress. Stereotaxic injection of U0126, a potent 
inhibitor of the ERK pathway, within the BLA blocked stress-induced behavioral 
depression. These results suggest that repeated stress produces lasting 
depression-like behaviors via the up-regulation of TRH and TRH receptors in the 
BLA.

There is a complex relationship between stressful situations and the onset of 
depression. 7-Fluoro-1,3-diphenylisoquinoline-1-amine (FDPI) has been reported 
to have an antidepressant-like effect in the forced swimming test (FST). The aim 
of this study was to investigate the antidepressant-like effect of FDPI 
administered to mice before or after the acute restraint stress (ARS). The mice 
were submitted to the ARS for 7 h. Two treatments with FDPI (10 mg/kg) were 
performed: in the first treatment, the mice received FDPI 30 min before ARS 
(pre-treatment) and in the second treatment mice received FDPI 10 min after the 
ARS (post-treatment). Thirty minutes after FDPI administration, the FST and 
locomotor activity were carried out. ARS induced depressive-like behavior in the 
FST. Both treatments with FDPI were effective against the increase in immobility 
time in the FST.Moreover, ARS increased lipid peroxidation and intracellular 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels as well as decreased catalase activity in 
prefrontal cortical samples of mice. Pre- and post-treatments with FDPI reduced 
lipid peroxidation and ROS, and post-treatment restored catalase activity. 
Superoxide dismutase was not altered by stress and/or FDPI. Monoamine oxidase 
(MAO) activities increased in the prefrontal-cortices of mice submitted to the 
ARS protocol and treatments with FDPI abolished this increase. Hepatic MAO 
activities were not altered in the livers of mice submitted to ARS and FDPI 
treatments. The serotonin uptake was increased in the prefrontal-cortices of 
mice submitted to the ARS protocol and both treatments with FDPI abolished this 
increase. The antidepressant-like effect of FDPI appears to involve the 
modulation of oxidative stress and the monoaminergic system, without inhibiting 
hepatic MAO activity.

A mouse model of depression has been recently developed by exogenous 
corticosterone (CORT) administration, which has shown to mimic HPA-axis induced 
depression-like state in animals. The present study aimed to examine the 
antidepressant-like effect and the possible mechanisms of resveratrol, a 
naturally occurring polyphenol of phytoalexin family, on depressive-like 
behavior induced by repeated corticosterone injections in mice. Mice were 
injected subcutaneously (s.c.) with 40mg/kg corticosterone (CORT) chronically 
for 21days. Resveratrol and fluoxetine were administered 30min prior to the CORT 
injection. After 21-days treatment with respective drugs, behavioral and 
biochemical parameters were estimated. Since brain derived neurotrophic factor 
(BDNF) has been implicated in antidepressant activity of many drugs, we also 
evaluated the effect of resveratrol on BDNF in the hippocampus. Three weeks of 
CORT injections in mice resulted in depressive-like behavior, as indicated by 
the significant decrease in sucrose consumption and increase in immobility time 
in the forced swim test and tail suspension test. Further, there was a 
significant increase in serum corticosterone level and a significant decrease in 
hippocampus BDNF level in CORT-treated mice. Treatment of mice with resveratrol 
significantly ameliorated all the behavioral and biochemical changes induced by 
corticosterone. These results suggest that resveratrol produces an 
antidepressant-like effect in CORT-induced depression in mice, which is possibly 
mediated by rectifying the stress-based hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) 
axis dysfunction paradigm and upregulation of hippocampal BDNF levels.

Glucocorticoids act rapidly at the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) to inhibit 
stress-excitatory neurons and limit excessive glucocorticoid secretion. The 
signaling mechanism underlying rapid feedback inhibition remains to be 
determined. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that the 
canonical glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) is required for appropriate 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulation. Local PVN GR knockdown 
(KD) was achieved by breeding homozygous floxed GR mice with Sim1-cre 
recombinase transgenic mice. This genetic approach created mice with a KD of GR 
primarily confined to hypothalamic cell groups, including the PVN, sparing GR 
expression in other HPA axis limbic regulatory regions, and the pituitary. There 
were no differences in circadian nadir and peak corticosterone concentrations 
between male PVN GR KD mice and male littermate controls. However, reduction of 
PVN GR increased ACTH and corticosterone responses to acute, but not chronic 
stress, indicating that PVN GR is critical for limiting neuroendocrine responses 
to acute stress in males. Loss of PVN GR induced an opposite neuroendocrine 
phenotype in females, characterized by increased circadian nadir corticosterone 
levels and suppressed ACTH responses to acute restraint stress, without a 
concomitant change in corticosterone responses under acute or chronic stress 
conditions. PVN GR deletion had no effect on depression-like behavior in either 
sex in the forced swim test. Overall, these findings reveal pronounced sex 
differences in the PVN GR dependence of acute stress feedback regulation of HPA 
axis function. In addition, these data further indicate that glucocorticoid 
control of HPA axis responses after chronic stress operates via a 
PVN-independent mechanism.

BACKGROUND: Stress exposure is one of the greatest risk factors for psychiatric 
illnesses like major depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder. 
However, not all individuals exposed to stress develop affective disorders. 
Stress resilience, the ability to experience stress without developing 
persistent psychopathology, varies from individual to individual. Enhancing 
stress resilience in at-risk populations could potentially protect against 
stress-induced psychiatric disorders. Despite this fact, no resilience-enhancing 
pharmaceuticals have been identified.
METHODS: Using a chronic social defeat (SD) stress model, learned helplessness 
(LH), and a chronic corticosterone (CORT) model in mice, we tested if ketamine 
could protect against depressive-like behavior. Mice were administered a single 
dose of saline or ketamine and then 1 week later were subjected to 2 weeks of 
SD, LH training, or 3 weeks of CORT.
RESULTS: SD robustly and reliably induced depressive-like behavior in control 
mice. Mice treated with prophylactic ketamine were protected against the 
deleterious effects of SD in the forced swim test and in the dominant 
interaction test. We confirmed these effects in LH and the CORT model. In the LH 
model, latency to escape was increased following training, and this effect was 
prevented by ketamine. In the CORT model, a single dose of ketamine blocked 
stress-induced behavior in the forced swim test, novelty suppressed feeding 
paradigm, and the sucrose splash test.
CONCLUSIONS: These data show that ketamine can induce persistent stress 
resilience and, therefore, may be useful in protecting against stress-induced 
disorders.

Interleukin 1 (IL-1) plays a critical role in stress responses, and its mRNA is 
induced in the brain by restraint stress. Previously, we reported that IL-1 
receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) knockout (KO) mice, which lacked IL-1Ra molecules 
that antagonize the IL-1 receptor, showed anti-depression-like behavior via 
adrenergic modulation at the age of 8 weeks. Here, we report that IL-1Ra KO mice 
display an anxiety-like phenotype that is induced spontaneously by aging in the 
elevated plus-maze (EPM) test. This anxiety-like phenotype was improved by the 
administration of diazepam. The expression of the anxiety-related molecule 
glucocorticoid receptor (GR) was significantly reduced in 20-week-old but not in 
11-week-old IL-1Ra KO mice compared to wild-type (WT) littermates. The 
expression of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) was not altered between IL-1Ra 
KO mice and WT littermates at either 11 or 20 weeks old. Analysis of monoamine 
concentration in the hippocampus revealed that tryptophan, the serotonin 
metabolite 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA), and the dopamine metabolite 
homovanillic acid (HVA) were significantly increased in 20-week-old IL-1Ra KO 
mice compared to littermate WT mice. These findings strongly suggest that the 
anxiety-like behavior observed in older mice was caused by the complicated 
alteration of monoamine metabolism and/or GR expression in the hippocampus.

Silibinin, a natural flavonoid antioxidant isolated from extracts of the milk 
thistle herb, has recently been identified as having anti-hepatotoxic and 
anticancer properties. In this paper, we investigated the effects of silibinin 
on behavior and neuroplasticity in mice subjected to chronic unpredictable mild 
stress (CUMS). After 5 consecutive weeks of CUMS, the mice were treated with 
silibinin (100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg by oral gavage) for 3 consecutive 
weeks. The results showed that silibinin administration significantly alleviated 
the CUMS-induced depressive-like behavior, including the total number of squares 
crossed and the frequency of rearing in the open field test, the immobility time 
in the tail suspension test and the forced swimming test. Furthermore, silibinin 
treatment increased the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), 
serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) in the prefrontal cortex and 
hippocampus. Our study provides new insight into the protective effects of 
silibinin on the depressive status of CUMS mice, specifically by improving 
neuroplasticity and neurotransmission.

BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder is a prevalent disease that is 
inadequately treated with currently available interventions. Stress increases 
susceptibility to depression in patients and rodent models. Depression is also 
associated with aberrant activation of inflammation, such as increases in 
circulating levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α 
(TNFα). The two main goals of this study were (i) to identify cytokine changes 
measuring a broad panel of 19 cytokines, and (ii) to test if a pre-conditioning 
stress altered the inflammatory response to a subsequent stress.
RESULT: Stress-induced changes in mouse plasma cytokines were measured by 
multiplex following administration of one or two daily stresses of inescapable 
foot shocks using the learned helplessness paradigm for modeling depression-like 
behavior. Administration of inescapable foot shocks increased plasma levels of 
IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, IL-3, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17A, IL-5, GM-CSF, IL-12(p70), IFN-γ, 
MIP-1α, MIP-1β, IL-1α, IL-2, KC, RANTES and G-CSF, with peak levels occurring in 
the range of 6 to 12 hr after stress. Pre-conditioning the mice 24 hr before 
with an equivalent inescapable foot shock stress resulted in similar magnitudes 
of increases in most cytokines as occurred after a single stress, but 
accelerated the increase, causing the levels of most cytokines to peak 1 hr 
after stress. These results demonstrate that a single stress induces the 
expression of many cytokines, and that sequential, daily stresses accelerates 
the rate of cytokine production.
CONCLUSIONS: Acute stress broadly activates inflammation in mice, and the 
inflammatory response is more rapid following repeated stress, actions that may 
contribute to deleterious effects of stress on depression and other 
stress-linked diseases.

BACKGROUND: Psychological stressors may cause affective disorders, such as 
depression and anxiety, by altering expressions of corticotropin releasing 
factor (CRF), serotonin (5-HT), and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the brain. This 
study investigated the effects of essential oil from Asarum heterotropoides 
(EOAH) on depression-like behaviors and brain expressions of CRF, 5-HT, and TH 
in mice challenged with stress.
METHODS: Male ICR mice received fragrance inhalation of EOAH (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 
and 2.0 g) for 3 h in the special cage capped with a filter paper before start 
of the forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST). The duration 
of immobility was measured for the determination of depression-like behavior in 
the FST and TST. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine as 
positive control was administered at a dose of 15 mg/kg (i.p.) 30 min before 
start of behavioral testing. Immunoreactivities of CRF, 5-HT, and TH in the 
brain were also measured using separate groups of mice subjected to the FST.
RESULTS: EOAH at higher doses (1.0 and 2.0 g) reduced immobility time in the FST 
and TST. In addition, EOAH at a dose of 1.0 g significantly reduced the expected 
increases in the expression of CRF positive neurons in the paraventricular 
nucleus and the expression of TH positive neurons in the locus coeruleus, and 
the expected decreases of the 5-HT positive neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus.
CONCLUSION: These results provide strong evidence that EOAH effectively inhibits 
depression-like behavioral responses, brain CRF and TH expression increases, and 
brain 5-HT expression decreases in mice challenged with stress.

We investigated the question of whether an animal model of post-stroke 
depression in ischemic stroke can be developed by additional chronic mild stress 
(CMS) procedures. Behavioral and histopathological analysis was performed for 
examination of the depressive disorders in CMS, left middle cerebral artery 
occlusion (MCAO) and CMS after MCAO (MCAO+CMS) in mice. In all depressant 
screening tests involving open field, sucrose preference, forced swim and Morris 
water maze test, MCAO+CMS mice showed more significant depressive behaviors than 
MCAO mice. MCAO+CMS mice also showed distinct deficits in forced swim and Morris 
water maze test compared with CMS. In the histopathological analysis, prominent 
atrophic changes were seen in the striatum and midbrain of MCAO treated mice 
compared with CMS. MCAO+CMS mice showed a decrease of proliferative and 
differentiated neuronal cells in the striatum and hippocampus with dopaminergic 
neuronal injuries in the midbrain as compared with CMS and MCAO alone treated 
mice. Treatment of MCAO+CMS mice with aripiprazole resulted in reduction of all 
depressive behaviors examined, particularly in the Morris water maze test. 
Recovered dopaminergic neuronal injuries in the midbrain and enhanced 
neurogenesis in the hippocampus were also demonstrated. Our results suggest that 
CMS after ischemic stroke can lead to severe depressive-like behavior compared 
with CMS or MCAO alone treated mice via neurodegeneration in the primary lesion 
and secondary extrafocal sites and degradation of neurogenesis, and these 
behavioral and histopathological changes are reversed by treatment with 
aripiprazole. Thus adjunct therapy with an antipsychotic may exert its 
antidepressant effects via neuroprotection and neurogenesis in CMS-treated 
ischemic mice.

Stress is known to affect neurotrophic factor expression, which induces 
depression-like behavior. However, whether there are time-dependent changes in 
neurotrophic factor mRNA expression following stress remains unclear. In the 
present study, we tested whether chronic stress exposure induces long-term 
changes in depression-related behavior, serum corticosterone, and hippocampal 
proliferation as well as neurotrophic factor family mRNA levels, such as 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), 
neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), in the mouse 
hippocampus. The mRNA level of neurotrophic factors (BDNF, NGF, NT-3, and CNTF) 
was measured using the real-time PCR. The serum corticosterone level was 
evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and, for each subject, the 
hippocampal proliferation was examined by 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine immunostaining. 
Mice exhibited depression-like behavior in the forced-swim test (FST) and 
decreased BDNF mRNA and hippocampal proliferation in the middle of the stress 
exposure. After 15 days of stress exposure, we observed increased immobility in 
the FST, serum corticosterone levels, and BDNF mRNA levels and degenerated 
hippocampal proliferation, maintained for at least 2 weeks. Anhedonia-like 
behavior in the sucrose preference test and NGF mRNA levels were decreased 
following 15 days of stress. NGF mRNA levels were significantly higher 1 week 
after stress exposure. The current data demonstrate that chronic stress exposure 
induces prolonged BDNF and NGF mRNA changes and increases corticosterone levels 
and depression-like behavior in the FST, but does not alter other neurotrophic 
factors or performance in the sucrose preference test.

Increasing evidence shows that inflammation may contribute to the 
pathophysiology of depression. Apigenin, one type of natural flavone, has a 
number of biological actions including anti-inflammatory effects. Although it 
has potential antidepressant activity in a chronic mild stress model, the 
mechanisms of antidepressant effect for apigenin remain unclear. Here, we 
examined the effects of apigenin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced 
depressive-like behavior in male mice. A single administration of LPS (0.5mg/kg, 
i.p.) increased the immobility time in the tail suspension test (TST) and 
reduced sucrose preference without changing spontaneous locomotor activity in 
open field test (OFT). Pre-treatment with apigenin (25, 50mg/kg, i.p.) or 
fluoxetine (positive control drug, 20mg/kg, i.p.) once daily for 7 consecutive 
days prevented the abnormal behavior induced by LPS. Apigenin or fluoxetine also 
effectively attenuated LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines 
IL-1β (interleukin-1β) and TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor-α). Moreover, apigenin 
or fluoxetine significantly suppressed the inducible nitric oxide synthase 
(iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression at both the mRNA and protein 
level via the modulation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation in the 
prefrontal cortex. Additionally, apigenin (50mg/kg, i.p.) or fluoxetine 
(20mg/kg, i.p.) effectively reversed the depressive-like behavior induced by 
TNF-α (0.1fg/site, i.c.v.) without altering the locomotor activity. These 
results demonstrate that apigenin exhibits antidepressant-like effects in LPS 
treated mice, partially due to its anti-inflammatory properties.

OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this study was to evaluate the anti-depressant 
effects of pharmacopuncture using sumsu (Bufonis venenum).
METHODS: Animals were divided into three groups (control, sham, and 
experimental), with eight mice per group. The sham and the experimental groups 
were exposed to 2 hours of immobilization stress daily for 14 days. They were 
also injected with normal saline (sham) or subjected to pharmacopuncture with 
sumsu at the acupoints HT7, SP6, and GV20 (experimental). The depression or 
anxiety-like behaviors of the mice in each group were evaluated 1 day after 
treatment.
RESULTS: There was no difference in locomotor activity between the groups during 
the open-field test; i.e., all groups had normal motor function. However, the 
open-field and the forced-swimming tests revealed that depression and 
anxiety-like behaviors were decreased significantly in the group treated with 
sumsu pharmacopuncture.
CONCLUSION: Sumsu pharmacopuncture attenuated depressive or anxiety-like 
behavior in mice stressed with chronic immobilization. These results suggest 
that sumsu pharmacopuncture has therapeutic potential for treating 
neuropsychiatric disorders such as anxiety or depression disorder.

Metabolomics was applied to a C57BL/6N mouse model of chronic unpredictable mild 
stress (CMS). Such mice were treated with two antidepressants from different 
categories: fluoxetine and imipramine. Metabolic profiling of the hippocampus 
was performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis on samples 
prepared under optimized conditions, followed by principal component analysis, 
partial least squares-discriminant analysis, and pair-wise orthogonal 
projections to latent structures discriminant analyses. Body weight measurement 
and behavior tests including an open field test and the forced swimming test 
were completed with the mice as a measure of the phenotypes of depression and 
antidepressive effects. As a result, 23 metabolites that had been differentially 
expressed among the control, CMS, and antidepressant-treated groups demonstrated 
that amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, adenosine receptors, and 
neurotransmitters are commonly perturbed by drug treatment. Potential predictive 
markers for treatment effect were identified: myo-inositol for fluoxetine and 
lysine and oleic acid for imipramine. Collectively, the current study provides 
insights into the molecular mechanisms of the antidepressant effects of two 
widely used medications.

  Numerous rodent models of depression have been reported, most requiring a long 
experimental period and significant effort. We explored a new potential mouse 
model for depression by investigating whether exposure to a 15-day chronic 
stress paradigm could induce depression-like behavior in ICR mice. Animals in 
the stress-exposed groups were subjected to 3 h of restraint while immersed in a 
28°C water bath daily for 15 consecutive days. Immobility time in the forced 
swim test was increased in the chronic stress-exposed mice compared with the 
controls. Serum corticosterone levels were also much higher in the stressed mice 
than in the control mice. Hippocampal cell survival (BrdU-positive cells) and 
neurotrophic factor (NGF, TrkA) mRNA levels were significantly decreased in the 
chronic stress-exposed mice compared with controls. Administration of the 
anti-depressant drugs clomipramine (20 mg/kg/d) or imipramine (30 mg/kg/d) did 
not change the immobility time in the forced swim test, but treatment with 
lithium (100 mg/kg/d) did result in slight improvement. These results suggest 
that this 15-day chronic stress paradigm can induce depression-like behavior and 
neurological changes, in a short time and with minimal effort, facilitating the 
assessment of treatments for depression.

We recently demonstrated that exposure to early life stress exacerbates nerve 
injury-induced thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity in adult male and female 
mice. Accumulating evidence suggests that chronic pain causes emotional 
dysfunction, such as anxiety and depression. In the present study, we 
investigated the impact of early life stress on depression-like behavior after 
nerve injury in mice. In addition, we examined the expression of brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of 
depression. Early life stress was induced by maternal separation between 2 and 3 
weeks of age combined with social isolation after weaning (MSSI). At 9 weeks of 
age, the sciatic nerve was partially ligated to elicit neuropathic pain. 
Depression-like behavior was evaluated using the forced swim test at 12 weeks of 
age. Tissue samples from different regions of the brain were collected at the 
end of maternal separation (3 weeks of age) or after the forced swim test (12 
weeks of age). At 12 weeks of age, immobility time in the forced swim test was 
increased only in MSSI-stressed female mice with nerve injury. BDNF expression 
was increased in male, but not female, MSSI-stressed mice at 3 weeks of age. 
However, MSSI stress did not impact BDNF expression in male or female mice at 12 
weeks of age. Our findings suggest that exposure to early life stress 
exacerbates emotional dysfunction induced by neuropathic pain in a sex-dependent 
manner. Changes in BDNF expression after early life stress may be associated 
with neuropathic pain-induced depression-like behavior in adulthood. 
Furthermore, sex differences in BDNF expression after exposure to early life 
stress may contribute to sex-specific susceptibility to neuropathic pain-induced 
emotional dysfunction.

Psychosocial stress is associated with altered immunity, anxiety and depression. 
Previously we showed that repeated social defeat (RSD) promoted microglia 
activation and social avoidance behavior that persisted for 24days after 
cessation of RSD. The aim of the present study was to determine if imipramine (a 
tricyclic antidepressant) would reverse RSD-inducedsocial avoidance and 
ameliorate neuroinflammatory responses. To test this, C57BL/6 mice were divided 
into treatment groups. One group from RSD and controls received daily injections 
of imipramine for 24days, following 6 cycles of RSD. Two other groups were 
treated with saline. RSD mice spent significantly less time in the interaction 
zone when an aggressor was present in the cage. Administration of imipramine 
reversed social avoidance behavior, significantly increasing the interaction 
time, so that it was similar to that of control mice. Moreover, 24days of 
imipramine treatment in RSD mice significantly decreased stress-induced mRNA 
levels for IL-6 in brain microglia. Following ex vivo LPS stimulation, microglia 
from mice exposed to RSD, had higher mRNA expression of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β, 
and this was reversed by imipramine treatment. In a second experiment, 
imipramine was added to drinking water confirming the reversal of social 
avoidant behavior and decrease in mRNA expression of IL-6 in microglia. These 
data suggest that the antidepressant imipramine may exert its effect, in part, 
by down-regulating microglial activation.

Depression is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder with an unclear molecular 
etiology. Inflammatory cytokines and molecular intermediates (including 
prostaglandins) are suggested to be involved in depression; however, the roles 
of prostaglandins and their respective receptors are largely unknown in 
depression. Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we show here that 
chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on T helper type 2 cells 
(CRTH2), a second receptor for prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), mediates 
depression-related behavior in mice. CRTH2-deficient (CRTH2(-/-)) mice showed 
antidepressant-like activity in a chronic corticosterone treatment-induced 
depression. Consistent with this observation, the pharmacological inhibition of 
CRTH2 via the clinically available drug ramatroban also rescued abnormal social 
interaction and depression-related behavior in well-established models, 
including chronic corticosterone-, lipopolysaccharide-, and tumor-induced 
pathologically relevant depression models. Importantly, chronic stress via 
corticosterone treatment increased mRNA levels in PGD2-producing enzymes, such 
as cyclooxygenase-2 and lipocalin-type PGD2 synthase, in the brain. Furthermore, 
the activity of the hippocampal noradrenergic system but not the dopaminergic or 
serotonergic systems was increased in CRTH2(-/-) mice. Together with the 
observation that untreated CRTH2(-/-) mice showed antidepressant-like activity 
in the forced swim test, these results provide evidence that central 
CRTH2-mediated signaling is critically involved in depression-related behavior.

Homer1a is implicated in depression in humans and depression-like behavior in 
mice. To further understand the role of Homer1a in stress-induced emotional 
changes, we applied very mild stress to Homer1a knockout (H1a KO) mice. The 
wild-type (WT) and H1a KO mice were restrained for 2h daily for 7 consecutive 
days at the same time of the day. The restraint was so mild that no changes in 
anxiety- or depression-like behavior were detected in either type of mice. 
However, total locomotion in the open field test and forced swimming test was 
increased by restraint in H1a KO mice only. After behavior, we made brain slices 
to examine neuronal excitability in cingulate cortex pyramidal cells and 
synaptic efficiency in hippocampal CA1 synapses. The excitability, assessed on 
the basis of the frequency of spikes elicited by current injection, was 
increased by restraint in H1a KO mice. The synaptic efficiency was evaluated by 
comparing the input-output relationship between the size of fiber volley and the 
slope of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials, and was shown to be increased 
by restraint in H1a KO mice only. Thus, predictable subtle stress, which failed 
to induce behavioral or electrophysiological changes in WT mice, resulted in a 
minor behavioral change that accompany upregulation of neuronal excitability and 
synaptic efficiency in H1a KO mice, suggesting that Homer1a may play a critical 
role in resilience to subtle stress.

Stress in our daily life severely affects the normal physiology of the 
biological system. Dysregulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis 
has been implicated in the development of depression-like behavior, which 
remains under diagnosed and poorly treated. Exogenous corticosterone (CORT) 
administration has been demonstrated to develop a depression model, which has 
shown to mimic HPA-axis induced depression-like state in rodents. In the present 
study, the effect of a novel 5HT3 receptor, 4i was examined on CORT induced 
depression in mice. CORT (30mg/kg, subcutaneously) was given for 4-weeks to mice 
in control group, while mice in drug treated group were given 4i (0.5-1mg/kg, 
intraperitoneally)/fluoxetine (as a positive control, 10mg/kg), for the last 
2-weeks of CORT dosing. Repeated CORT dosing caused depression-like behavior in 
mice as indicated by increased despair effects in forced swim test (FST) and 
anhedonia in sucrose preference test. In addition, CORT administration induced 
oxidative load in the brain with significant increase in pro-oxidant (lipid 
peroxidation and nitrite levels) markers and a substantial decline in 
anti-oxidant defense (catalase and reduced glutathione levels) system, 
indicating a direct effect of stress hormones in the induction of the brain 
oxidative damage. On the other hand, 4i and fluoxetine treatment reversed the 
CORT induced depressive-like deficits. Furthermore, 4i and fluoxetine prevented 
CORT induced oxidative brain insults, which may plausibly demonstrate one of the 
key mechanisms for antidepressant-like effects of the compounds. Thus, the study 
suggests that 5HT3 antagonist; 4i may be implicated as pharmacological 
intervention targeting depressive-like anomaly associated with HPA-axis 
dysregulation.

Early life social isolation stress (SIS), a well-known chronic stress paradigm, 
is contributed to a number of pathophysiological and neurochemical changes 
including depression and anxiety. The underlying mechanisms for these disorders 
in socially isolated animals have not been fully cleared. Previous studies have 
shown that N-Methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor function is changed by social 
isolation condition. It is now well recognized that NMDA receptor blockade can 
exhibit antidepressant and anxiolytic actions. In our study, postnatal day 21-25 
mice were randomly housed for 4 weeks under either social condition (SC) or 
isolated condition (IC). Then, animals were subjected to different behavioral 
experiments to investigate whether blockade of NMDA receptor resulted in 
behavioral alterations in animals. Social isolation stress induced depressive 
and anxiety-like behaviors in IC animals in comparison with SC mice. Also, we 
applied subeffective doses of antagonists including ketamine (1mg/kg), MK-801 
(0.05mg/kg), and magnesium sulfate (10mg/kg) to both SC and IC mice prior to 
behavioral experiments. Administration of a single dose of all mentioned drugs 
did not affect the SC mice but modulated the depressant effects of SIS on IC 
mice. Administration of NMDA receptor antagonists decreased the immobility time 
in the forced swimming test as well as an increase in grooming behavior in 
splash test. However, anxiety-like behaviors in IC animals remained unchanged in 
hole-board test and open field test after blockade of NMDA receptors. Taken 
together, our results showed the possible involvement of the NMDA receptors in 
the depressive, but not anxiety-like behaviors induced by SIS.

Cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine), a major bioactive component isolated from 
Cordyceps militaris, has multiple pharmacological activities. This study is 
attempted to investigate whether cordycepin (COR) possesses beneficial effects 
on chronic unpredictable mild stress- (CUMS-) induced behavioral deficits 
(depression-like behaviors) and explore the possible mechanisms. ICR mice were 
subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress for 42 consecutive days. Then, 
COR and fluoxetine (FLU, positive control drug) were administered for 21 
consecutive days at the last three weeks of CUMS procedure. The classical 
behavioral tests, open field test (OFT), sucrose preference test (SPT), tail 
suspension test (TST), and forced swimming test (FST), were applied to evaluate 
the antidepressant effects of COR. Then the serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline 
(NE) concentrations in hippocampal were evaluated by HPLC; tumor necrosis 
factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in hippocampal were evaluated, and the 
proteins of TNF-α, IL-6, NF-κBP65 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR), and brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in hippocampal were evaluated by Western blot. Our 
results indicated that 6 weeks of CUMS exposure induced significant 
depression-like behavior, with low 5-HT and NE levels, high TNF-α and IL-6 in 
brain and high hippocampal TNF-α, IL-6, P-NF-κBP65, and 5-HT2AR levels, and low 
BDNF expression levels. Whereas, chronic COR (20, 40 mg/kg) treatments reversed 
the behavioral deficiency induced by CUMS exposure, treatment with COR 
normalized the change of TNF-α, IL-6, 5-HT, and NE levels, which demonstrated 
that COR could partially restore CUMS-induced 5-HT receptor impairments and 
inflammation. Besides, hippocampal BDNF expressions were also upregulated after 
COR treatments. In conclusion, COR remarkably improved depression-like behavior 
in CUMS mice and its antidepressant activity is mediated, at least in part, by 
the upregulating BDNF and downregulating 5-HT2AR levels and inflammation in 
hippocampus.

Many evidences strongly suggest that a mitochondrial deficit is implicated in 
major depression. A mitochondrial deficit leads to mitochondrial stress 
responses, including the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), which 
is associated with certain brain disorders such as spastic paraplegia and 
Parkinson's disease. However, there is no evidence regarding the relationship 
between depressive disorder and UPRmt. Mice treated with chronic restraint 
stress showed significant depressive-like behaviors in the tail suspension and 
forced swim tests, decreased oxygen consumption rate, and increased levels of 
molecules associated with UPRmt such as Hspa9, Hspd1, Ubl5, Abcb10, and ClpP. 
All of the UPRmt-related molecules were significantly correlated with 
depressive-like behavior in the forced swim test. Thus, the present study is to 
reveal a relationship between the UPRmt and depressive disorder, suggesting that 
the UPRmt is a potential drug target for depressive disorders.

The present study investigated the effects of chronic social defeat stress on 
several behavioral parameters, and the expression of dopaminergic markers, i.e., 
dopamine D1 receptors (D1Rs), dopamine D2 receptors (D2Rs), and dopamine and 
cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-regulated phosphoprotein-32 (DARPP-32), in 
the prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala (AMY), and hippocampus (HIP) of mouse 
brains. After 10days of social defeat stress, the defeated mice were divided 
into two groups: one group underwent a series of behavioral tests. The other 
group was sacrificed on the 11th day and tissue samples were collected for 
Western blotting. The behavioral tests comprised tests of locomotion, light/dark 
preference, social interaction, as well as the novel object recognition test 
(NORT), Morris water maze, and forced swimming test (FST). We measured the 
expression of D1Rs, D2Rs, total DARPP-32, phospho-Thr34 or Thr75-DARPP-32 using 
Western blotting. The defeated mice showed increased anxiety- and 
depression-like behaviors, and impaired cognition. No significant differences in 
D1Rs and D2Rs expression were shown between defeated and control mice in any 
area studied. A significantly increased expression in total DARPP-32, and 
phospho-DARPP-32 was observed in the PFC or AMY of defeated mice. These data 
suggest that alterations in dopaminergic markers may be involved in anxiety- and 
depression-like behaviors, and cognitive impairment induced by social defeat 
stress.

PURPOSE: Mood disorders such as anxiety and depression are prevalent psychiatric 
illness, but the role of 5HT1A in the anti-depressive effects of exercise has 
been rarely known yet. We investigated whether long-term exercise affected a 
depressive-like behavior and a hippocampal 5HT1A receptor-mediated cAMP/PKA/CREB 
signaling in depression mice model.
METHODS: To induce depressive behaviors, mice were subjected to 14 consecutive 
days of restraint stress (2 hours/day). Depression-like behaviors were measured 
by forced swimming test (TST), and anxiety-like behavior was assessed by 
elevated plus maze (EPM). Treadmill exercise was performed with 19 m/min for 60 
min/day, 5 days/week from weeks 0 to 8. Restraint stress was started at week 6 
week and ended at week 8. To elucidate the role of 5HT1A in depression, the 
immunoreactivities of 5HT1A were detected in hippocampus using 
immunohistochemical technique.
RESULTS: Chronic/repeated restraint stress induced behavioral anxiety and 
depression, such as reduced time and entries in open arms in EPM and enhanced 
immobility time in FST. These anxiety and depressive behaviors were ameliorated 
by chronic exercise. Also, these behavioral changes were concurrent with the 
deficit of 5HT1A and cAMP/PKA/CREB cascade in hippocampus, which was coped with 
chronic exercise.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that chronic exercise may improve the 
disturbance of hippocampal 5HT1A-regulated cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling in a 
depressed brain, thereby exerting an antidepressive action.

Strong evidence has shown that caffeine exerts antidepressant-like effects in 
chronic stress situations by increasing dopamine levels. However, whether 
caffeine mediates the dopaminergic system and interferes with the resilience to 
social defeat stress in mice is unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate 
the role of caffeine in the behavioral responses to social defeat stress and the 
possible regulatory role of the dopaminergic system. Mice experienced chronic 
social defeat stress for 10 days. Caffeine was administered intraperitoneally 
before, during and after social defeat stress. The time spent in interaction 
zone, social interaction ratio and sucrose preference test was used to measure 
the social avoidance and anhedonia in mice. The results showed that chronic 
pretreatment with caffeine for 14 days and for 10 days during stress reversed 
the avoidance of social behavior and anhedonia induced by social defeat stress 
in mice, suggesting the enhancement of the resilience to social defeat stress 
induced by caffeine. However, neither the treatment with caffeine only during 
the social defeat stress for 10 days nor the treatment with acute caffeine after 
defeat stress altered the resilience to stress. Furthermore, chronic caffeine 
treatment did not affect the normal locomotor activity and the desperate 
behavior in naïve mice. Moreover, the antagonism of dopamine D1 receptor and not 
D2 receptor reversed the effect of caffeine on the social avoidance and 
depressive-like behavior. Finally, pretreatment with higher doses of caffeine 
did not affect the behavioral response to social defeat stress. Taken together, 
our findings provide new insight into the effects of caffeine on social 
avoidance and anhedonia in mice. In addition, our results illustrated the value 
of measuring changes in depressive-like behavior before and after social defeat 
stress to determine the potential treatment of caffeine on depression through 
the regulation of dopaminergic system.

The lateral habenula (LHb) regulates the activity of monoaminergic neurons in 
the brainstem. This area has recently attracted a surge of interest in 
psychiatry because studies have reported the pathological activation of the 
habenula in patients with major depression and in animal models. The LHb plays a 
significant role in the pathophysiology of depression; however, how habenular 
neurons are activated to cause various depression symptoms, such as reduced 
motivation and sleep disturbance, remain unclear. We hypothesized that 
dysfunctional astrocytes may cause LHb hyperactivity due to the defective uptake 
activity of extracellular glutamate, which induces depressive-like behaviors. We 
examined the activity of neurons in habenular pathways and performed behavioral 
and sleep analyses in mice with pharmacological and genetic inhibition of the 
activity of the glial glutamate transporter GLT-1 in the LHb. The 
habenula-specific inhibition of GLT-1 increased the neuronal firing rate and the 
level of c-Fos expression in the LHb. Mice with reduced GLT-1 activity in the 
habenula exhibited a depressive-like phenotype in the tail suspension and 
novelty-suppressed feeding tests. These animals also displayed increased 
susceptibility to chronic stress, displaying more frequent avoidant behavior 
without affecting locomotor activity in the open-field test. Intriguingly, the 
mice showed disinhibition of rapid eye movement sleep, which is a characteristic 
sleep pattern in patients with depression. These results provide evidence that 
disrupting glutamate clearance in habenular astrocytes increases neuronal 
excitability and depressive-like phenotypes in behaviors and sleep.

CONTEXT: Previous studies from our laboratory indicated that both acute and 
subchronic administration of Fructus Akebiae (FAE) [the fruit of Akebiae quinata 
(Thunb.) Decne, (Lardizabalaceae)] produce antidepressant-like effects in animal 
depressive behavior tests. FAE contains approximately 70% of hederagenin (HG) as 
its main chemical component.
OBJECTIVE: This study compared the antidepressant ability of FAE with that of HG 
in mice and further investigated the antidepressant-like effects and potential 
mechanisms of HG in rats subjected to unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice received FAE (50 mg/kg) and HG (20 mg/kg) once a day 
via intragastric administration (i.g.) for 3 weeks. The anxiolytic and 
antidepressant activities of FAE and HG were compared using elevated plus maze 
(EPM) and behavioral despair tests including tail suspension test (TST) and 
forced swimming test (FST), respectively. Antidepressant effects of HG (5 mg/kg) 
were assessed using the UCMS depressive rat model. Moreover, the levels of 
monoamine neurotransmitters and relevant gene expression in UCMS rats' 
hippocampi were determined through high-performance liquid chromatography with 
electrochemical detection and real-time polymerase chain reaction techniques.
RESULTS: The results of our preliminary screening test suggest that HG at 20 
mg/kg, while not FAE at 50 mg/kg, significantly decreased the immobility in both 
TST and FST compared with the vehicle group when administered chronically; 
however, there were no significant differences observed between the HG and the 
FAE group. Chronic administration of HG failed to significantly reverse the 
altered crossing and rearing behavioral performance, time spent in the open arm 
and closed entries in the EPM, even if they showed an increased tendency, but HG 
significantly increased the percent of sucrose preference in the sucrose 
preference test (SPT) and decreased the immobility time in the FST. HG showed 
that significant increases of norepinephrine and serotonin levels and exhibited 
a tendency to increase the expression of 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) 1A 
receptor mRNA, and to significantly decrease the expression of the mRNA for the 
serotonin transporter (5-HTT). However, there were no significant differences in 
the expression of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor.
CONCLUSION: These findings confirm the antidepressant-like effects of HG in a 
behavioral despair test and UCMS rat model, which may be associated with 
monoamine neurotransmitters and 5-HTT mRNA expression.

The possible involvement of the PI3K/AKT/BDNF/VGF signaling in rapid-acting 
antidepressant-like effects of antidepressants has been explored progressively 
by more studies. However, whether this signaling participates in the 
antidepressant-like effects of acetyl-l-carnitine (ALC) has not been examined. 
Herein, we assessed the antidepressant-like effects of ALC using the forced 
swimming test (FST). Our results demonstrated the dose-effect relationship of 
acute administration of ALC (5, 25, 50 and 100mg/kg, i.p.) and showed that it 
dose-dependently decreased the immobility time on FST of mice. In addition, ALC 
(100 mg/kg, i.p.) also reversed depressive-like behavior and the down-regulation 
of phosphorylated AKT (pAKT), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and 
neuropeptide VGF in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of mice induced by 
chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) paradigm. Further, 
intra-cerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusions of LY294002 (10 nmol/side), a 
specific phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, significantly prevented 
the antidepressant-like effect of ALC (100mg/kg, i.p.). In conclusion, our 
results demonstrated that ALC exerts rapid-acting antidepressant-like effects 
that might be mediated by the PI3K/AKT/BDNF/VGF signaling pathway.

Depression is an inflammatory, commonly occurring and lethal psychiatric 
disorder having high lifetime prevalence. Preclinical and clinical studies 
suggest that activation of immuno-inflammatory and oxido-nitrosative stress 
pathways play major role in the pathophysiology of depression. Honokiol (HNK) is 
a biphenolic neolignan possessing multiple biological activities including 
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anxiolytic, antidepressant and neuroprotective. 
The present study investigated the effect of HNK (2.5 and 5 mg/kg, i.p.) 
pretreatment (30 min prior to LPS) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (0.83 mg/kg, 
i.p.) induced depressive like behavior, neuroinflammation, and oxido-nitrosative 
stress in mice. HNK pretreatment at both the doses significantly attenuated LPS 
induced depressive-like behavior by reducing the immobility time in forced swim 
and tail suspension test, and by improving the anhedonic behavior observed in 
sucrose preference test. HNK pretreatment ameliorated LPS induced 
neuroinflammation by reducing IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α level in hippocampus (HC) 
and prefrontal cortex (PFC). HNK pretreatment prevented LPS evoked 
oxidative/nitrosative stress via improving reduced glutathione level along with 
reduction in the lipid peroxidation and nitrite level in HC and PFC. 
Pretreatment with HNK also prevented the increase in plasma corticosterone 
(CORT) and decrease in hippocampal BDNF level in LPS challenged mice. In 
conclusion, current investigation suggested that HNK pretreatment provided 
protection against LPS-induced depressive like behavior which may be mediated by 
repression of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as oxido-nitrosative stress in 
HC and PFC. Our results strongly speculated that HNK could be a therapeutic 
approach for the treatment of depression and other pathophysiological conditions 
which are closely associated with neuroinflammation and oxido-nitrosative 
stress.

Working with mice represents a smart method to study pathophysiological 
mechanisms in vivo. However, using animals as model organisms also bears immense 
caveats. While many aspects in animal research are meanwhile standardized (e.g. 
nutrition, housing, health) the breeding environment remains unaddressed. 
Moreover, since the "production" of mice is mostly performed pragmatically, 
continuous mating (CM) represents a common method to boost the amount of 
offspring. This condition implies simultaneous pregnancy and lactation in 
presence of the male, which is associated with increased costs for the breeding 
dam. Facing the widely-accepted impact of perinatal conditions, our aim was to 
elucidate how CM affects emotional behaviour of mouse offspring. We therefore 
compared pregnant mice in CM with mice raising their pups without potentially 
disturbing influences. According to our hypothesis CM-deriving offspring should 
demonstrate increased anxiety and depression-like behaviour shaped by pre- and 
postnatal stress of the mother. Maternal care, i.e. nest building and pup 
retrieval, was analysed around delivery. To assess the emotional state of the 
offspring, males and females of either condition were exposed to a behavioural 
test battery for exploration, anxiety and fear, social and despair behaviour. In 
addition we analysed corticosterone as stressphysiological correlate. Our study 
demonstrates that CM affects the emotional phenotype regarding nearly all 
parameters addressed. These findings emphasize (i) the impact of the perinatal 
environment on stress-associated behaviour such as depression, and (ii) the need 
to imply perinatal conditions in the experimental design to decrease the risk of 
artefacts and increase the overall validity of animal studies.

Several preclinical studies have revealed antidepressant and anxiolytic-like 
effect of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. In our earlier study, we have reported the 
antidepressive-like effect of 3-methoxy-N-p-tolylquinoxalin-2-carboxamide 
(QCM-4) in obese mice subjected to chronic stress. The present study deals with 
the biochemical mechanisms associated with depression co-morbid with obesity. 
Mice were fed with high fat diet (HFD) for 14 weeks, further subjected for 
treatment with QCM-4 (1 and 2mg/kg p.o.) and standard antidepressant 
escitalopram (ESC) (10mg/kg p.o.) for 28 days. Behavioral assays for depression 
such as sucrose preference test (SPT), forced swim test (FST) and for anxiety 
such as light and dark test (LDT) and hole board test (HBT) were performed in 
obese mice. Biochemical assessments including plasma leptin and corticosterone 
concentration followed by brain oxidative stress parameters malonaldehyde (MDA) 
and reduced glutathione (GSH) were performed. Results confirmed that QCM-4 
exhibits antidepressive effect by increasing the sucrose consumption in SPT, 
reducing immobility time in FST and anxiolytic effect by increasing transitions 
and time in light chamber in LDT, increasing head dip and crossing score in HBT. 
Furthermore, QCM-4 attenuated the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis 
hyperactivity by reducing the plasma corticosterone, reversing altered plasma 
leptin, restoring the imbalance of brain MDA and GSH concentration. In 
conclusion, QCM-4 showed antidepressive and anxiolytic effect by reversing the 
behavioral alterations that were supported by biochemical estimations in obese 
mice.

Perilla frutescens (Perilla leaf), a garnishing vegetable in East Asian 
countries, as well as a plant-based medicine, has been used for centuries to 
treat various conditions, including depression. Several studies have 
demonstrated that the essential oil of P. frutescens (EOPF) attenuated the 
depressive-like behavior in mice. The present study was designed to test the 
anti-depressant effects of EOPF and the possible mechanisms in an chronic, 
unpredictable, mild stress (CUMS)-induced mouse model. With the exposure to 
stressor once daily for five consecutive weeks, EOPF (3, 6, and 9 mg·kg(-1)) and 
a positive control drug fluoxetine (20 mg·kg(-1)) were administered through 
gastric intubation to mice once daily for three consecutive weeks from the 3(rd) 
week. Open-field test, sucrose consumption test, tail suspension test (TST), and 
forced swimming test (FST) were used to evaluate the behavioral activity. The 
contents of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and its metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic 
acid (5-HIAA), in mouse hippocampus were determined by HPLC-ECD. Serum 
interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α levels were 
evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results showed that 
CUMS significantly decreased the levels of 5-HT and 5-HIAA in the hippocampus, 
with an increase in plasma IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α levels. CUMS also reduced 
open-field activity, sucrose consumption, as well as increased immobility 
duration in FST and TST. EOPF administration could effectively reverse the 
alterations in the concentrations of 5-HT and 5-HIAA; reduce the IL-6, IL-1β, 
and TNF-α levels. Moreover, EOPF could effectively reverse alterations in 
immobility duration, sucrose consumption, and open-field activity. However, the 
effect was not dose-dependent. In conclusion, EOPF administration exhibited 
significant antidepressant-like effects in mice with CUMS-induced depression. 
The antidepressant activity of EOPF might be related to the relation between 
alteration of serotonergic responses and anti-inflammatory effects.

Chronic stress, the administration of glucocorticoids and the prolonged 
activation of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) are reported to induce affective 
changes in humans and rodents that resemble a depressive state. However, data 
concerning the behavioral and molecular effects of the selective activation of 
specific GRs are limited, and the conclusions derived remain debatable. In this 
study, our goal was to investigate the behavioral and molecular changes 
following the prolonged activation of GRs in mice via exposure to the specific 
agonist dexamethasone (DEX). C57BL/6J mice were injected daily with DEX (4 
mg/kg, i.p.) or saline, and the behavior of the animals was assessed in the 
following paradigms: the forced swimming test (FST), the light-dark box test, 
the saccharin preference test and activity boxes. The mRNA expression levels of 
the corticosteroid receptors mineralocorticoid (MR, Nr3c2) and glucocorticoid 
(GR, Nr3c1), selected stress dependent genes and glial markers were analyzed in 
the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum. DEX-treated mice exhibited a 
variety of depression-like behaviors: increased time of immobility in the FST, a 
reduced preference for saccharin consumption and increased anxiety-like 
behavior. Behavioral alterations were accompanied by a decrease in the mRNA 
expression of GR and the increased expression of Fkbp5 and Sgk1 in the 
prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum of DEX-treated mice. Furthermore, 
our results indicate a decrease in the mRNA expression of glutamate aspartate 
transporter (GLAST, Slc1a3), an astroglial cell marker, in the hippocampus and 
prefrontal cortex. These results demonstrate that the prolonged activation of GR 
receptors induced a depression-like state in mice, activated stress-related 
genes and induced a decrease in the mRNA expression of GLAST, an astroglial 
marker, in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Together, the results reported 
here challenge several hypotheses concerning the role of GRs in the development 
of behavioral and molecular alterations relevant to stress-related disorders, 
such as depression, under the same experimental conditions.

AIM: To investigate the antidepressant-like effects of a novel 5-HT3 receptor 
antagonist N-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-3-methoxyquinoxalin-2-carboxamide (6z) in 
acute and chronic murine models of depression.
METHODS: 5-HT3 receptor antagonism was examined in guinea pig ileum in vitro. A 
tail suspension test (TST) was used as acute depression model to evaluate the 
antidepressant-like behavior in mice treated with 6z (0.5-2 mg/kg, ip). In 
chronic depression model, mice were exposed to a 4-week chronic unpredictable 
stress (CUS) protocol, and treated with 6z (0.5-2 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1), po) or a 
positive drug fluoxetine (10 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1), po) in the last 2 weeks, followed 
by behavioral and biochemical assessments.
RESULTS: The 5-HT3 receptor antagonism of 6z (pA2=7.4) in guinea pig ileum was 
more potent than that of a standard 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron 
(pA2=6.9). In acute depression model, 6z administration significantly decreased 
the immobility duration. In chronic depression model, 6z administration reversed 
CUS-induced depressive-like behavior, as evidenced by increased immobility 
duration in the forced swim test and sucrose preference in the sucrose 
preference test. Furthermore, chronic administration of 6z prevented CUS-induced 
brain oxidative stress, with significant reduction of pro-oxidant markers and 
elevation of antioxidant enzyme activity. Moreover, chronic administration of 6z 
attenuated CUS-induced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperactivity, as 
shown by reduced plasma corticosterone levels. Similar results were observed in 
the fluoxetine-treated group.
CONCLUSION: 6z is a novel 5-HT3 receptor antagonist with potential 
antidepressant-like activities, which may be related to modulating 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and attenuating brain oxidative damage.

Chronic mild stress (CMS) has been reported to induce an anhedonic-like state in 
mice that resembles some of the symptoms of human depression. In the present 
study, we used a chronic mild stress animal model of depression and anxiety to 
examine the responses of two strains of mice that have different behavioral 
responsiveness. An outbred ICR and an inbred C57BL/6 strain of mice were 
selected because they are widely used strains in behavioral tests. The results 
showed that the inbred C57BL/6 and outbred ICR mice were similarly responsive to 
CMS treatment in sucrose intake test (SIT) and open field test (OFT). However, 
the two strains showed quite different responses in forced swimming test (FST) 
and novelty-suppressed feeding (NSF) test after 3 weeks of CMS treatment. Only 
C57BL/6 mice displayed the depression- and anxiety-like behavioral effects in 
response to CMS treatment in FST and NSF test. Our results suggest that there 
are differences in responsiveness to CMS according to the different types of 
strain of mice and behavioral tests. Therefore, these results provide useful 
information for the selection of appropriate behavioral methods to test 
depression- and anxiety-like behaviors using CMS in ICR and C57BL/6 mice.

Epidemiological studies have shown that early life adverse events have long-term 
effects on the susceptibility to subsequent stress exposure in adolescence, but 
the precise mechanism is unclear. In the present study, mice on postnatal day 
21-28 were randomly assigned to either a group or isolated cages for 8 weeks. 
The socially isolated (SI) mice exhibited a higher level of spontaneous 
locomotor activity, a longer duration of immobility in the forced swimming test 
(FST), significantly less prepulse inhibition (PPI) and an increase in 
aggressive (but not attack) behavior. However, acute stress markedly exacerbated 
the attack counts of the SI mice but did not affect the group housing (GH) mice. 
SI mice exhibited higher synaptosomal NR2A and NR2B levels in the hippocampus as 
compared to the GH mice. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings of CA1 neurons in 
hippocampal slices showed that the SI mice exhibited a higher input-output 
relationship of NMDAR-EPSCs as compared to the GH mice. Application of the NR2B 
-specific antagonist ifenprodil produced a greater attenuating effect on 
NMDAR-EPSCs in slices from the SI mice. NMDAR EPSCs recorded from the SI mice 
had a slower deactivation kinetic. MK-801, CPP and ifenprodil, the NMDA 
antagonists, reversed acute stress-induced exaggeration of aggressive and 
depressive behaviors. Furthermore, acute stress-induced exacerbation of attack 
behavior in the SI mice was abolished after the knockdown of NR2B expression. 
These results suggest that social isolation-induced increased expression of NMDA 
receptors in the hippocampus involves stress exacerbation of aggressive 
behaviors. Amelioration of aggressive behaviors by NMDA antagonists may open a 
new avenue for the treatment of psychopathologies that involve outbursts of 
emotional aggression in neglected children.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of folic acid on 
depressive-like behavior induced by chronic administration of corticosterone in 
mice. Corticosterone (20mg/kg, p.o.) was administered once a day for 21days. 
Folic acid (30mg/kg, p.o.) or fluoxetine (10mg/kg, positive control, p.o.) was 
administered immediately after corticosterone injection during the last 7days of 
corticosterone treatment. On the 22nd day, animals were submitted to tail 
suspension test, open-field test and splash test. Corticosterone treatment 
caused a depressive-like behavior, evidenced by increased immobility time in the 
tail suspension test and decreased time in which mice spent grooming in the 
splash test. Repeated folic acid or fluoxetine administration significantly 
abolished corticosterone-induced depressive-like behavior. Chronic 
administration of corticosterone decreased levels of serum corticosterone in 
mice. Neither folic acid, nor fluoxetine treatment reversed this impairment. 
These findings indicate a robust effect of folic acid in reversing behavioral 
alterations induced by corticosterone model of depression in mice, suggesting 
that this vitamin may be an alternative approach for the management of 
depressive symptoms.

Developmental exposure to low dose of methylmercury (MeHg) has a long-lasting 
effect on memory and attention deficits in humans, as well as cognitive 
performance, depression-like behavior and the hippocampal levels of the 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf)in mice. The Bdnf receptor TrkB is a key 
player of Bdnf signaling. Using transgenic animals, here we analyzed the effect 
of the full-length TrkB overexpression (TK+) on behavior impairments induced by 
perinatal MeHg. TK overexpression in the MeHg-exposed mice enhanced generalized 
anxiety and cue memory in the fear conditioning (FC) test. Early exposure to 
MeHg induced deficits in reversal spatial memory in the Morris water maze (MWM) 
test and depression-like behavior in the forced swim test (FST) in only 
wild-type (WT) mice but did not affect these parameters in TK+ mice. These 
changes were associated with TK+ effect on the increase in Bdnf 2, 3, 4 and 6 
transcription in the hippocampus as well as with interaction of TK+ and MeHg 
factors for Bdnf 1, 9a and truncated TrkB.T1 transcripts in the prefrontal 
cortex. However, the MeHg-induced anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus 
maze (EPM) and open field (OF) tests was ameliorated by TK+ background only in 
the OF test. Moreover, TK overexpression in the MeHg mice did not prevent 
significant stress-induced weight loss during the period of adaptation to 
individual housing in metabolic cages. These TK genotype-independent changes 
were primarily accompanied by the MeHg-induced hippocampal deficits in the 
activity-dependent Bdnf 1, 4 and 9a variants, TrkB.T1, and transcripts for 
important antioxidant enzymes glyoxalases Glo1 and Glo2 and glutathione 
reductase Gsr. Our data suggest a role of full-length TrkB in buffering against 
memory deficits and depression-like behavior in the MeHg mice but propose the 
involvement of additional pathways, such as the antioxidant system or TrkB.T1 
signaling, in stress- or anxiety-related responses induced by developmental MeHg 
exposure.

OBJECTIVE: Parkinson's disease (PD) may be caused by the interaction of a number 
of factors, including genetics, toxins, oxidative stress, mitochondrial 
abnormalities, and aging. Studies have shown that consumption of an 
antioxidant-rich diet may reduce the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases. 
The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of the flavonoid hesperidin in an 
animal model of PD induced by 6-hidroxidopamine (6-OHDA).
METHODS: Aged mice were treated with hesperidin (50 mg/kg) during 28 d after an 
intracerebroventricular injection of 6-OHDA. The enzymatic activities of 
superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, 
and glutathione S-transferase, the levels of glutathione, reactive oxygen 
species, total reactive antioxidant potential, dopamine and its levels of 
metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid, was analyzed 
in the striatum. The behavioral parameters (depressive-like, memory, and 
locomotor) were measured.
RESULTS: This study demonstrated that hesperidin (50 mg/kg) treatment was 
effective in preventing memory impairment in the Morris water maze test, as well 
as, depressive-like behavior in the tail suspension test. Hesperidin attenuated 
the 6-OHDA-induced reduction in glutathione peroxidase and catalase activity, 
total reactive antioxidant potential and the dopamine and its metabolite levels 
in the striatum of aged mice. 6-OHDA increased reactive oxygen species levels 
and glutathione reductase activity in the striatum, and these alterations were 
mitigated by chronic administration of hesperidin.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated a protective effect of hesperidin on the 
neurotoxicity induced by 6-OHDA in aged mice, indicating that it could be useful 
as a therapy for the treatment of PD.

Animal models of depression are used to study pathophysiology of depression and 
to advance therapeutic strategies. Stress-induced depression models in rodents 
are widely used. However, amenable behavioral criteria and experimental 
procedures that are suitable for animal models have not been established. Given 
that depression is clinically diagnosed by multiple symptomatic criteria and 
stress effects are imposed to the brain non-specifically in stress-induced 
depression models, analyses of depression states in rodents using multiple 
symptomatic criteria may provide more power than any methods relying on a single 
symptomatic criterion. To address this, C57BL/6 inbred mice were restrained for 
2 h daily for 14 d, and depression states of individual mice were assessed using 
the U-field test, behavioral assessment developed to measure animal's 
sociability, and the tail suspension test and/or forced swim test, which are the 
typical methods that measure psychomotor withdrawal states. Although the 
majority of these mice showed severe depressive behaviors in both tests, a 
significant proportion of them, which were all inbred mice and received the same 
amount of restraints, expressed differential depression states in the 
sociability test and psychomotor withdrawal tests. To easily read-out 
differential depression states of individuals in two different tests, a standard 
method and basic parameters required to construct two-way behavior matrix were 
introduced. The utility and features of this two-way behavior analysis method 
for studies of different depressive states of individuals were discussed.

BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence suggests that commensal bacteria consumption 
has the potential to have a positive impact on stress-related psychiatric 
disorders. However, the specific bacteria influencing behaviors related to 
anxiety and depression remain unclear. To this end, we compared the effects of 
two different Bifidobacteria on anxiety and depression-like behavior; an 
antidepressant was also used as a comparator.
METHODS: Innately anxious BALB/c mice received daily Bifidobacterium longum (B.) 
1714, B. breve 1205, the antidepressant escitalopram or vehicle treatment for 6 
weeks. Behavior was assessed in stress-induced hyperthermia test, marble 
burying, elevated plus maze, open field, tail suspension test, and forced swim 
test. Physiological responses to acute stress were also assessed.
KEY RESULTS: Both Bifidobacteria and escitalopram reduced anxiety in the marble 
burying test; however, only B. longum 1714 decreased stress-induced 
hyperthermia. B. breve 1205 induced lower anxiety in the elevated plus maze 
whereas B. longum 1714 induced antidepressant-like behavior in the tail 
suspension test. However, there was no difference in corticosterone levels 
between groups.
CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: These data show that these two Bifidobacteria strains 
reduced anxiety in an anxious mouse strain. These results also suggest that each 
bacterial strain has intrinsic effects and may be beneficially specific for a 
given disorder. These findings strengthen the role of gut microbiota 
supplementation as psychobiotic-based strategies for stress-related brain-gut 
axis disorders, opening new avenues in the field of neurogastroenterology.

Recent evidence implicates adult hippocampal neurogenesis in regulating 
behavioral and physiologic responses to stress. Hippocampal neurogenesis occurs 
across the lifespan, however the rate of cell birth is up to 300% higher in 
adolescent mice compared to adults. Adolescence is a sensitive period in 
development where emotional circuitry and stress reactivity undergo plasticity 
establishing life-long set points. Therefore neurogenesis occurring during 
adolescence may be particularly important for emotional behavior. However, 
little is known about the function of hippocampal neurons born during 
adolescence. In order to assess the contribution of neurons born in adolescence 
to the adult stress response and depression-related behavior, we transiently 
reduced cell proliferation either during adolescence, or during adulthood in 
GFAP-Tk mice. We found that the intervention in adolescence did not change adult 
baseline behavioral response in the forced swim test, sucrose preference test or 
social affiliation test, and did not change adult corticosterone responses to an 
acute stressor. However following chronic social defeat, adult mice with reduced 
adolescent neurogenesis showed a resilient phenotype. A similar transient 
reduction in adult neurogenesis did not affect depression-like behaviors or 
stress induced corticosterone. Our study demonstrates that hippocampal neurons 
born during adolescence, but not in adulthood are important to confer 
susceptibility to chronic social defeat.

This study employs an oral operant conditioning paradigm to evaluate the effects 
of repeated social defeat during adolescence on the reinforcing and motivational 
actions of ethanol in adult OF1 mice. Social interaction, emotional and 
cognitive behavioral aspects were also analyzed, and real-time polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) experiments were performed to study gene expression changes in 
the mesocorticolimbic and hypothalamus-hypophysis-adrenal (HHA) axis. Social 
defeat did not alter anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze or 
cognitive performance in the passive avoidance and Hebb-Williams tests. A social 
interaction test revealed depression-like symptoms and social subordination 
behavior in defeated OF1 mice. Interestingly, social defeat in adolescence 
significantly increased the number of effective responses, ethanol consumption 
values and motivation to drink. Finally, real-time PCR analyses revealed that 
social defeat significantly increased tyrosine hydroxylase and 
corticotropin-releasing hormone in the ventral tegmental area and 
paraventricular nucleus, respectively. In contrast, mu-opioid receptor gene 
expression was decreased in the nucleus accumbens of socially defeated mice. In 
summary, these findings suggest that exposure to social defeat during 
adolescence increases vulnerability to the rewarding effects of ethanol without 
affecting emotional or cognitive performance. The gene expression alterations we 
have observed in the mesocorticolimbic and HHA axis systems of defeated mice 
could be related with their increased ethanol consumption. These results endorse 
future research into pharmacological strategies that modulate these systems for 
the treatment of social stress-related alcohol consumption problems.

Psychological stress can have devastating and lasting effects on a variety of 
behaviors, especially those associated with mental illnesses such as anxiety and 
depression. Animal models of chronic stress are frequently used to elucidate the 
mechanisms underlying the relationship between stress and mental health 
disorders and to develop improved treatment options. The current study expands 
upon a novel chronic stress paradigm for mice: predatory stress. The predatory 
stress model incorporates the natural predator-prey relationship that exists 
among rats and mice and allows for greater interaction between the animals, in 
turn increasing the extent of the stressful experience. In this study, we 
evaluated the behavioral effects of exposure to 15 days of predatory stress on 
an array of behavioral indices. Up to 2 weeks after the end of stress, adult 
male mice showed an increase of anxiety-like behaviors as measured by the open 
field and social interaction tests. Animals also expressed an increase in 
depressive-like behavior in the sucrose preference test. Notably, performance on 
the novel object recognition task, a memory test, improved after predatory 
stress. Taken as a whole, our results indicate that 15 exposures to this 
innovative predatory stress paradigm are sufficient to elicit robust 
anxiety-like behaviors with evidence of co-morbid depressive-like behavior, as 
well as changes in cognitive behavior in male mice.

Neurons of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) regulate the 
hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the autonomic nervous system. 
Females lacking functional GABA(B) receptors because of a genetic disruption of 
the R1 subunit have altered cellular characteristics in and around the PVN at 
birth. The genetic disruption precluded appropriate assessments of physiology or 
behavior in adulthood. The current study was conducted to test the long term 
impact of a temporally restricting pharmacological blockade of the GABA(B) 
receptor to a 7-day critical period (E11-E17) during embryonic development. 
Experiments tested the role of GABA(B) receptor signaling in fetal development 
of the PVN and later adult capacities for adult stress related behaviors and 
physiology. In organotypic slices containing fetal PVN, there was a female 
specific, 52% increase in cell movement speeds with GABA(B) receptor antagonist 
treatment that was consistent with a sex-dependent lateral displacement of cells 
in vivo following 7 days of fetal exposure to GABA(B) receptor antagonist. 
Anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors, open-field activity, and HPA 
mediated responses to restraint stress were measured in adult offspring of 
mothers treated with GABA(B) receptor antagonist. Embryonic exposure to GABA(B) 
receptor antagonist resulted in reduced HPA axis activation following restraint 
stress and reduced depression-like behaviors. There was also increased 
anxiety-like behavior selectively in females and hyperactivity in males. A sex 
dependent response to disruptions of GABA(B) receptor signaling was identified 
for PVN formation and key aspects of physiology and behavior. These changes 
correspond to sex specific prevalence in similar human disorders, namely anxiety 
disorders and hyperactivity.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Butea superba (BS) is a Thai medicinal plant 
that has been used as a folk medicine to improve physical and mental conditions 
and to prevent impaired sexual performance in middle-aged or elderly males. We 
have previously reported that this plant extract could improve cognitive 
deficits and depression-like behavior in olfactory bulbectomized mice, an animal 
model of dementia and depression.
AIM OF THE STUDY: In this study we examined the effect of BS on depression-like 
behavior in mice subjected to unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) to 
clarify the antidepressant-like activity of BS and the molecular mechanism 
underlying this effect.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: UCMS mice were administered BS daily (300 mg of dried 
herb weight/kg, p.o.) or a reference drug, imipramine (IMP, 10 mg/kg, i.p.), 1 
week after starting the UCMS procedure. We employed the sucrose preference test 
and the tail suspension test to analyze anhedonia and depression-like behavior 
of mice, respectively. Serum and brain tissues of mice were used for 
neurochemical and immunohistochemical studies. The UCMS procedure induced 
anhedonia and depression-like behavior, and BS treatment, as well as IMP 
treatment, attenuated these symptoms. UCMS caused an elevation of serum 
corticosterone level, an index of hyper-activation of the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, in a manner attenuated by BS and IMP 
treatment. BS treatment also attenuated UCMS-induced decrease in the expression 
levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA, cyclic AMP-responsive 
element binding protein (CREB) and a phosphorylated form of N-methyl-d-aspartate 
receptor subunit NR1, synaptic plasticity-related signaling proteins. Moreover, 
the UCMS procedure reduced doublecortin-positive cells in the dentate gyrus 
region of the hippocampus. BS administration reversed these UCMS-induced 
neurochemical and histological abnormalities.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that BS can ameliorate chronic stress-induced 
depression-like symptoms and that the effects of BS are mediated by restoring 
dysfunctions of the HPA axis and synaptic plasticity-related signaling systems 
and neurogenesis in the hippocampus.

Depression is one of the most prevalent mental illnesses, and causes a constant 
feeling of sadness and lose of interest, which often leads to suicide. Evidence 
suggests that depression is associated with aberrant MEK/ERK signaling. However, 
studies on MEK/ERK signaling in depression have only been done in a few brain 
regions, such as the hippocampus and mesolimbic reward pathways. Recent studies 
also implicate the involvement of the prefrontal cortex in depression. Thus, we 
examined the changes in MEK/ERK signaling in subregions of the prefrontal cortex 
of C57BL/6 mice by immunohistochemistry using phospho-MEK1/2 (Ser 217/221) and 
ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) antibodies. Mice were subjected to 21 consecutive days of 
restraint stress (for 2h daily), and depression-like behavior was evaluated 
using a sociability test and tail suspension test. The antidepressant, 
imipramine (20mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally 30min before restraint 
stress exposure. Chronic/repeated restraint stress produced depressive-like 
behavior, such as increased social avoidance in the social interaction test, and 
enhanced immobility time in the tail suspension test. This depressive behavior 
was ameliorated by imipramine. The behavioral changes well corresponded to a 
decrease in MEK/ERK immunoreactivity in the medial orbital (MO) cortex and 
dorsal endopiriform nuclei (DEn), which was averted by imipramine, but not in 
cingulate, prelimbic, infralimbic, and motor cortex. These results suggest that 
MEK/ERK signaling is disrupted in the DEn and MO subregions of the prefrontal 
cortex in the depressive phenotype, and that blocking a decrease in activated 
MEK/ERK is inherent to the antidepressant imipramine response.

The occurrence of chronic stress, depression, and anxiety can increase 
nociception in humans and may facilitate the transition from localized to 
chronic widespread pain. The mechanisms underlying chronic widespread pain are 
still unknown, hindering the development of effective pharmacological therapies. 
Here, we exposed C57BL/6J mice to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) to 
investigate how persistent stress affects nociception. Next, mice were treated 
with multiple intramuscular nerve growth factor (NGF) injections, which induced 
chronic widespread nociception. Thus, combination of CUS and NGF served as a 
model where psychophysiological impairment coexists with long-lasting 
hyperalgesia. We found that CUS increased anxiety- and depression-like behavior 
and enhanced basal nociception in mice. When co-applied with repeated NGF 
injections, CUS elicited a sustained long-lasting widespread hyperalgesia. In 
order to evaluate a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of chronic 
pain associated with stress, we hypothesized that the endocannabinoid system 
(ECS) may represent a target signaling system. We found that URB597, an 
inhibitor of the anandamide-degrading enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), 
and JZL184, an inhibitor of the 2-arachidonoyl glycerol-degrading enzyme 
monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), increased eCB levels in the brain and periphery 
and were both effective in reducing CUS-induced anxiety measured by the 
light-dark test and CUS-induced thermal hyperalgesia. Remarkably, the 
long-lasting widespread hyperalgesia induced by combining CUS and NGF was 
effectively reduced by URB597, but not by JZL184. Simultaneous inhibition of 
FAAH and MAGL did not improve the overall therapeutic response. Therefore, our 
findings indicate that enhancement of anandamide signaling with URB597 is a 
promising pharmacological approach for the alleviation of chronic widespread 
nociception in stress-exposed mice, and thus, it could represent a potential 
treatment strategy for chronic pain associated with neuropsychiatric disorders 
in humans.

Environmental factors can significantly affect disease prevalence, including 
neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression. The ratio of deuterium to protium 
in water shows substantial geographical variation, which could affect disease 
susceptibility. Thus the link between deuterium content of water and depression 
was investigated, both epidemiologically, and in a mouse model of chronic mild 
stress. We performed a correlation analysis between deuterium content of tap 
water and rates of depression in regions of the USA. Next, we used a 10-day 
chronic stress paradigm to test whether 2-week deuterium-depleted water 
treatment (91 ppm) affects depressive-like behavior and hippocampal SERT. The 
effect of deuterium-depletion on sleep electrophysiology was also evaluated in 
naïve mice. There was a geographic correlation between a content of deuterium 
and the prevalence of depression across the USA. In the chronic stress model, 
depressive-like features were reduced in mice fed with deuterium-depleted water, 
and SERT expression was decreased in mice treated with deuterium-treated water 
compared with regular water. Five days of predator stress also suppressed 
proliferation in the dentate gyrus; this effect was attenuated in mice fed with 
deuterium-depleted water. Finally, in naïve mice, deuterium-depleted water 
treatment increased EEG indices of wakefulness, and decreased duration of REM 
sleep, phenomena that have been shown to result from the administration of 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). Our data suggest that the 
deuterium content of water may influence the incidence of affective 
disorder-related pathophysiology and major depression, which might be mediated 
by the serotoninergic mechanisms.

Mice genetically depleted of brain serotonin do not display a depression-like 
behavioral phenotype.

Reductions in function within the serotonin (5HT) neuronal system have long been 
proposed as etiological factors in depression. Selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most common treatment for depression, and their 
therapeutic effect is generally attributed to their ability to increase the 
synaptic levels of 5HT. Tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) is the initial and 
rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of 5HT in the CNS, and losses 
in its catalytic activity lead to reductions in 5HT production and release. The 
time differential between the onset of 5HT reuptake inhibition by SSRIs 
(minutes) and onset of their antidepressant efficacy (weeks to months), when 
considered with their overall poor therapeutic effectiveness, has cast some 
doubt on the role of 5HT in depression. Mice lacking the gene for TPH2 are 
genetically depleted of brain 5HT and were tested for a depression-like 
behavioral phenotype using a battery of valid tests for affective-like disorders 
in animals. The behavior of TPH2(-/-) mice on the sucrose preference test, tail 
suspension test, and forced swim test and their responses in the unpredictable 
chronic mild stress and learned helplessness paradigms was the same as wild-type 
controls. While TPH2(-/-) mice as a group were not responsive to SSRIs, a subset 
responded to treatment with SSRIs in the same manner as wild-type controls with 
significant reductions in immobility time on the tail suspension test, 
indicative of antidepressant drug effects. The behavioral phenotype of the 
TPH2(-/-) mouse questions the role of 5HT in depression. Furthermore, the 
TPH2(-/-) mouse may serve as a useful model in the search for new medications 
that have therapeutic targets for depression that are outside of the 5HT 
neuronal system.

Maladaptive behavioral responses characteristic of post-traumatic stress 
disorders are notably resistant to treatment. We hypothesized that the 
pharmacological disruption of memories activated during reconsolidation might 
reverse established stress-induced increases in depression-like behaviors and 
cocaine reward. C57BL/6J mice were subjected to repeated social defeat stress 
(SDS), and examined for time spent immobile in a subsequent forced swim test 
(FST). An additional set of SDS-exposed mice were place-conditioned with 
cocaine, and tested for cocaine-conditioned place preference (CPP). All 
stress-exposed mice were then subjected to a single additional trial of SDS 
while under the influence of propranolol or cycloheximide to disrupt memory 
reconsolidation, then given one additional FST or CPP test the next day. Mice 
subjected to repeated SDS subsequently demonstrated increases in time spent 
immobile in the FST or in the cocaine-paired chamber. Vehicle-treatment followed 
by additional SDS exposure did not alter these behaviors, but propranolol or 
cycloheximide treatment reversed each of the potentiated responses in a 
dose-dependent manner. Overall, these results demonstrate that while repeated 
exposure to a social defeat stressor subsequently increased depression-like 
behavior and cocaine-CPP, disruption of traumatic memories made labile by 
re-exposure to SDS during reconsolidation may have therapeutic value in the 
treatment of established post-traumatic stress disorder-related behaviors.

Stressful events promote a wide range of neurotransmitter and neuroendocrine 
changes, which likely serve in an adaptive capacity. However, with repeated 
stressor exposure, behavioral disturbances, such as anxiety and depression, may 
develop. Moreover, re-exposure to a stressor for some time following an initial 
aversive experience may instigate especially pronounced neurochemical variations 
that favor the emergence of depression and anxiety. These outcomes may stem from 
any number of neurobiological changes, but increasing attention has focused on 
the potential contribution of inflammatory factors, such as cytokines. Given the 
distinct differences in stressor responsiveness that have been reported between 
males and females, alongside a much higher rate of mood disorders in females, we 
sought to examine whether repeated exposure to stressors would differentially 
influence elevated plus-maze behavior in male and female CD-1 mice, and whether 
such changes would be paralleled by variations of pro-inflammatory mRNA cytokine 
expression within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus. In males, the 
sensitization of interleukin (IL)-1β was evident in both brain regions in those 
mice that had initially been stressed and then 6 weeks later re-exposed to a 
stressor exhibiting higher IL-1β expression than did mice stressed on only a 
single occasion. Females demonstrated higher baseline expression of cytokine 
expression within the hippocampus, but neither a single exposure nor re-exposure 
stressor treatment produced significant cytokine elevations. In the PFC an acute 
stressor treatment increased IL-1R expression, but otherwise had little effect. 
In a plus-maze test, stressed male mice displayed markedly reduced latencies to 
the open arms that was evident in a test 6 weeks later irrespective of whether 
mice were re-exposed to a stressor, whereas in females this outcome was less 
evident. These studies are consistent with the perspective that female mice are 
relatively resilient toward stressor-induced cytokine elevations even though in 
humans females are generally more prone to developing mood disturbances.

Depression and anxiety disorders are often characterized by altered 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis re-/activity. However, the presence of 
a molecular link between dysbalanced neuroendocrine regulation and 
psychopathologies is not yet fully established. Earlier, we reported that high 
(HAB), normal (NAB) and low (LAB) anxiety-related behavior mice express 
divergent anxiety-related and passive/active coping phenotypes. Here, we studied 
mechanisms that might contribute to the different HPA axis reactivity observed 
in HAB, NAB and LAB mice and their involvement in the regulation of 
anxiety-related behavior and passive/active coping style. We found that HAB mice 
respond with significantly reduced corticosterone (CORT) secretion to an acute 
stressful stimulus and a blunted response in the Dex/CRH test compared to NAB 
and LAB mice. At the molecular level, higher expression of the glucocorticoid 
receptor (GR/Nr3c1) and decreased corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1 
(CRHR1) expression were observed in the pituitary of HAB mice. We further 
analyzed whether these stress mediators differed between the HAB, NAB and LAB 
lines in limbic system-associated brain regions and whether their interplay 
contributes to the phenotype. Interestingly, not only in the pituitary but also 
in almost all brain regions investigated, GR expression was significantly higher 
in HAB mice. In contrast, the amount of CORT in the brain structures analyzed 
was significantly lower in these animals. The expression of CRHR1 varied in the 
prefrontal cortex only. Since glucocorticoids regulate both GR and CRHR1, we 
treated HAB and NAB mice chronically with CORT. After 6 weeks of administration, 
reduced anxiety- and depression-like behaviors were observed in HAB mice, 
whereas increased anxiety was found in NABs. In both groups, GR, but not CRHR1, 
were significantly reduced. Taken together, our study proposes HAB mice as an 
animal model of simultaneous features of increased anxiety-related and 
depression-like behaviors with blunted HPA axis reactivity suggesting a 
dysregulated GR/CORT system as one key mechanism behind their phenotype.

There is a close relationship between chronic stress, glucocorticoids and 
depression. Psychiatric and cognitive symptoms resembling major depression have 
been observed in patients experiencing elevated glucocorticoid levels, and a 
high percentage of people suffering from depression have undergone a stressful 
event/events prior to the onset of this mental disorder. In our study, we 
investigated whether acute and chronic treatment of dexamethasone induces 
depression-like behavior in mice and if dexamethasone therapy influences the 
activity of antidepressant drugs with diverse modes of action. The 
antidepressant-like effect was assessed by the forced swim test in adult mice. 
The depressogenic-like activity of dexamethasone turned out to be 
dose-dependent: only the highest tested dose of the glucocorticoid (i.e., 
64μg/kg) given as a single injection increased immobility time, whereas 
16μg/kg/day of dexamethasone (but not 4μg/kg/day) administered repeatedly 
induced a significant alteration in animal behavior. These depressogenic doses 
of dexamethasone (i.e., 64μg/kg and 16μg/kg/day for an acute and repeated 
administration, respectively) diminished the antidepressant potential of the 
therapeutic doses of imipramine (10mg/kg), amitriptyline (10mg/kg), tianeptine 
(25mg/kg), mianserin (10mg/kg), citalopram (15mg/kg) and moclobemide (25mg/kg). 
Two main findings of our study should be particularly underlined: (1) both 
single and repeated administration of dexamethasone evoked a depression-like 
behavior of mice, (2) both single and repeated administration of dexamethasone 
were able to modify the activity of the antidepressant agents from various 
pharmacological groups, which may lead to a considerable reduction in the 
efficacy of pharmacotherapy prescribed for patients with mood disorders.

Previous studies in our laboratory examined the antidepressant potential of 
3-methoxy-N-p-tolylquinoxalin-2-carboxamide (QCM-4), a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist 
in acute and chronic rodent models of depression. The aim of present study was 
to investigate the effect of QCM-4 on chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) 
induced depression in obese mice using behavioral based battery tests and 
biochemical assessments. Depressive behavior was induced in obese mice by 
subjecting to different stress procedures for 28 days. The results indicated 
that the CUMS induced severe depressive behavior in obese mice as demonstrated 
by a significant decreased sucrose consumption, increased immobility time in 
forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST), decreased percent entries 
and time in open arm in elevated plus maze (EPM). Moreover, CUMS significantly 
increased the plasma glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides and total 
proteins in obese mice. Chronic treatment with QCM-4 (2 mg/kg po) and standard 
drug escitalopram (10 mg/kg po) significantly reversed the depressive behavioral 
changes (increased sucrose consumption, decreased immobility time in FST and 
TST, and increased the percent entries and time in open arm in EPM) and 
biochemical alterations (reversed the raised levels of plasma glucose, total 
cholesterol, triglycerides and total proteins) in obese mice subjected to CUMS. 
No alteration was observed in the locomotor score in obese mice. In conclusion, 
the results of the present study suggested that QCM-4 attenuated the depression 
co-morbid with obesity in mice subjected to CUMS which to some extent is 
mediated by reversing the "insulin resistance" or "altered plasma glucose" in 
obese mice.

Emodin, the major active component of Rhubarb, has shown neuroprotective 
activity. This study is attempted to investigate whether emodin possesses 
beneficial effects on chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced 
behavioral deficits (depression-like behaviors) and explore the possible 
mechanisms. ICR mice were subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress for 42 
consecutive days. Then, emodin and fluoxetine (positive control drug) were 
administered for 21 consecutive days at the last three weeks of CUMS procedure. 
The classical behavioral tests: open field test (OFT), sucrose preference test 
(SPT), tail suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test (FST) were applied to 
evaluate the antidepressant effects of emodin. Then plasma corticosterone 
concentration, hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels were tested to probe the mechanisms. Our 
results indicated that 6 weeks of CUMS exposure induced significant 
depression-like behavior, with high, plasma corticosterone concentration and low 
hippocampal GR and BDNF expression levels. Whereas, chronic emodin (20, 40 and 
80 mg/kg) treatments reversed the behavioral deficiency induced by CUMS 
exposure. Treatment with emodin normalized the change of plasma corticosterone 
level, which demonstrated that emodin could partially restore CUMS-induced HPA 
axis impairments. Besides, hippocampal GR (mRNA and protein) and BDNF (mRNA) 
expressions were also up-regulated after emodin treatments. In conclusion, 
emodin remarkably improved depression-like behavior in CUMS mice and its 
antidepressant activity is mediated, at least in part, by the up-regulating GR 
and BDNF levels in hippocampus.

The neurogenesis hypothesis of major depression has two main facets. One states 
that the illness results from decreased neurogenesis while the other claims that 
the very functioning of antidepressants depends on increased neurogenesis. In 
order to verify the latter, we have used cyclin D2 knockout mice (cD2 KO mice), 
known to have virtually no adult brain neurogenesis, and we demonstrate that 
these mice successfully respond to chronic fluoxetine. After unpredictable 
chronic mild stress, mutant mice showed depression-like behavior in forced swim 
test, which was eliminated with chronic fluoxetine treatment, despite its lack 
of impact on adult hippocampal neurogenesis in cD2 KO mice. Our results suggest 
that new neurons are not indispensable for the action of antidepressants such as 
fluoxetine. Using forced swim test and tail suspension test, we also did not 
observe depression-like behavior in control cD2 KO mice, which argues against 
the link between decreased adult brain neurogenesis and major depression.

Chronic stress is one of the major causes of depression, associated with 
behavioral and biochemical impairments. 5HT3 receptor antagonists (such as 
ondansetron) have shown alleviation of depressive symptomology in preclinical 
and in few clinical studies. However, their effects in chronic stress-induced 
depressive behavior and the underlying mechanism(s) are yet to be known. In the 
present study, the effects of a 5HT3 receptor antagonist, ondansetron were 
evaluated in chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)-evoked depressive behavior. In 
addition, the possible mechanism was determined by measuring plasma 
corticosterone (CORT) as a marker of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical 
(HPA)-axis activity and serotonin levels in the discrete brain regions. Mice 
were subjected to a battery of unpredictable stressors for 28 days. Ondansetron 
(0.05, 0.1 and 1mg/kg, p.o.) and fluoxetine (10mg/kg, p.o.) were administered 
during the last 14 days (day 15-28th) of CUS testing paradigm. The results 
showed that the 4-week CUS produced significant depressive behavior in mice, 
which included increased despair effects in forced swim test (FST) and 
reward-related deficits in sucrose preference test. Biochemical assays 
demonstrated a significant increase in percentage of plasma CORT and decrease in 
percentage of serotonin levels in the discrete brain regions of CUS mice. 
Chronic ondansetron treatment, similar to that of positive control fluoxetine, 
significantly reversed despair effects in FST and reward-related deficits in 
sucrose preference test. In addition, ondansetron and fluoxetine treatments 
significantly increased percentage of serotonin levels in the measured brain 
regions and attenuated HPA-axis hyperactivity, as evidenced by low percentage of 
plasma CORT levels in CUS mice. These findings indicate the potential role of 
ondansetron (a 5HT3 receptor antagonist) in reversing CUS-induced depressive 
behavior, which is possibly mediated by its modulating effects on the HPA-axis 
and serotonergic system. Further, the study represents that 5HT3 receptor 
antagonists can be a potential therapeutic candidate for stress-related 
depressive disorders.

BACKGROUND: In the present study, antidepressant-like activity of palmatine was 
evaluated in unstressed and stressed young male Swiss albino mice.
METHODS: The animals were subjected to unpredictable mild stress daily for 21 
successive days to induce depression-like behavior. Palmatine (0.25, 0.5, 1 
mg/kg, ip) was administered for 21 successive days to unstressed and stressed 
mice. The antidepressant-like activity was evaluated using the tail suspension 
test, forced swim test and sucrose preference test.
RESULTS: Palmatine (0.5 and 1 mg/kg, ip) significantly decreased immobility 
periods of unstressed and stressed mice in the forced swim test and tail 
suspension test, thus indicating its significant antidepressant-like activity. 
Only the highest dose (1 mg/kg) of palmatine significantly reversed the 
stress-induced decrease in sucrose preference. There was no significant effect 
on locomotor activity of the mice by palmatine and fluoxetine. The 
antidepressant-like activity of palmatine was found to be comparable to 
fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) administered for successive 21 days. Palmatine (0.5 and 1 
mg/kg, ip) significantly reversed the stress-induced increase in brain catalase 
levels, MAO-A activity, lipid peroxidation, plasma nitrite and corticosterone 
levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Palmatine showed significant antidepressant-like activity in 
unstressed and stressed mice probably through inhibition of MAO-A activity, 
decrease in plasma nitrite levels and due to its antioxidant activity. In 
addition, palmatine also showed antidepressant-like activity in stressed mice 
probably through decrease in plasma corticosterone levels.

Oxidative stress is considered to be a mechanism of major depression. Pycnogenol 
(PYC) is a natural plant extract from the bark of Pinus pinaster Aiton and has 
potent antioxidant activities. We studied the ameliorative effect of PYC on 
depression-like behavior in chronic corticosterone- (CORT-) treated mice for 20 
days. After the end of the CORT treatment period, PYC (0.2 mg/mL) was orally 
administered in normal drinking water. Depression-like behavior was investigated 
by the forced swimming test. Immobility time was significantly longer by CORT 
exposure. When the CORT-treated mice were supplemented with PYC, immobility time 
was significantly shortened. Our results indicate that orally administered PYC 
may serve to reduce CORT-induced stress by radical scavenging activity.

Development and characterization of animal models of depression are essential 
for fully understanding the pathogenesis of depression in humans. We made and 
analyzed a mouse model exhibiting social deficit and hyperphagia-like behavior 
using a subchronic and mild social defeat stress (sCSDS) paradigm. The body 
weight, food and water intake of mice were monitored during a test period, and 
their behaviors and serum components were analyzed at two stages: immediately 
after the sCSDS period and 1 month after the sCSDS. The body weight and food 
intake of defeated mice were significantly higher than control mice at the sCSDS 
period, and these differences were sustained until 1 month after the sCSDS, 
whereas the water intake of defeated mice was significantly higher than control 
mice for the period of sCSDS only. Behavioral analyses revealed that the 
defeated mice exhibit significant social aversion to unfamiliar mice in a social 
interaction test and a trend of anxiety-like behavior in an elevated-plus maze 
test. Possibly due to polydipsia-like symptoms, defeated mice had significantly 
lower levels of albumin and blood urea nitrogen than control mice immediately 
after the sCSDS period but not at 1 month after sCSDS. The present study 
revealed that our sCSDS mice keep much more water in their body than control 
mice. This study reports the first step toward an understanding of the 
mechanisms of stress-induced overhydration, over-eating and resultant weight 
gain.

Brain concussions are a serious public concern and are associated with 
neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression. Patients with concussion who 
suffer from depression often experience distress. Nevertheless, few pre-clinical 
studies have examined concussion-induced depression, and there is little 
information regarding its pharmacological management. Edaravone, a free radical 
scavenger, can exert neuroprotective effects in several animal models of 
neurological disorders. However, the effectiveness of edaravone in animal models 
of concussion-induced depression remains unclear. In this study, we examined 
whether edaravone could prevent concussion-induced depression. Mice were 
subjected to a weight-drop injury and intravenously administered edaravone 
(3.0 mg/kg) or vehicle immediately after impact. Serial magnetic resonance 
imaging showed no abnormalities of the cerebrum on diffusion T1- and T2-weighted 
images. We found that edaravone suppressed concussion-induced depressive-like 
behavior in the forced swim test, which was accompanied by inhibition of 
increased hippocampal and cortical oxidative stress (OS) and suppression of 
5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) translocation to the nuclear envelope in hippocampal 
astrocytes. Hippocampal OS in concussed mice was also prevented by the 
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase inhibitor, apocynin, and 
administration of BWB70C, a 5-LOX inhibitor, immediately and 24 h after injury 
prevented depressive-like behaviors in concussed mice. Further, antidepressant 
effects of edaravone were observed in mice receiving 1.0 or 3.0 mg/kg of 
edaravone immediately after impact, but not at a lower dose of 0.1 mg/kg. This 
antidepressant effect persisted up to 1 h after impact, whereas edaravone 
treatment at 3 h after impact had no effect on concussion-induced 
depressive-like behavior. These results suggest that edaravone protects against 
concussion-induced depression, and this protection is mediated by suppression of 
OS and 5-LOX translocation.

Valsartan reverses depressive/anxiety-like behavior and induces hippocampal 
neurogenesis and expression of BDNF protein in unpredictable chronic mild stress 
mice.

Valsartan is a synthetic non-peptide angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist 
that dilates blood vessels and reduces blood pressure by blocking the action of 
angiotensin, and is safe and well tolerated in hypertensive patients. 
Population-based studies have suggested a positive role of sartans in reducing 
the risk of depression. This study aimed at investigating the effects of 
valsartan on unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) mice by means of 
open-field test (OFT), novel-suppressed feeding test (NSF), tail suspension test 
(TST), forced swimming test (FST) and sucrose preference test (SPT). The effects 
of valsartan on antidepression/antianxiety, hippocampal neurogenesis and BDNF 
expression were evaluated in these behavior tests. Chronic administration of 
valsartan (5-40 mg/kg/d, p.o.) increased the time spent in the center of the 
field in OFT and the latency to eat in NSF, reduced the immobility time in both 
TST and FST, and increased the sucrose preference in SPT. A similar effect was 
observed in the positive control group of which the mice were treated with 
imipramine (30 mg/kg/d, i.p.) and tested by OFT, NSF, TST, FST and SPT. In this 
study, an impairment in hippocampal neurogenesis which parallelled with a 
reduced BDNF level in the hippocampus was observed in the mice that were treated 
with UCMS for 6 weeks. But the proliferation of progenitor cells and generation 
of new hippocampal neurons were restored after these mice were treated with 
valsartan (40 mg/kg/d, p.o.) for 4 weeks. These findings demonstrate that 
valsartan is an effective antidepressant/antianxiety reagent and can promote the 
hippocampal neurogenesis and expression of BDNF.

Enkephalin knockout male mice are resistant to chronic mild stress.

Enhanced stress reactivity or sensitivity to chronic stress increases the 
susceptibility to mood pathologies such as major depression. The opioid peptide 
enkephalin is an important modulator of the stress response. Previous studies 
using preproenkephalin knockout (PENK KO) mice showed that these animals exhibit 
abnormal stress reactivity and show increased anxiety behavior in acute stress 
situations. However, the consequence of enkephalin deficiency in the reactivity 
to chronic stress conditions is not known. In this study, we therefore submitted 
wild-type (WT) and PENK KO male mice to chronic stress conditions, using the 
chronic mild stress (CMS) protocol. Subsequently, we studied the CMS effects on 
the behavioral and hormonal level and also performed gene expression analyses. 
In WT animals, CMS increased the expression of the enkephalin gene in the 
paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus and elevated the 
corticosterone levels. In addition, WT mice exhibited enhanced anxiety in the 
zero-maze test and depression-related behaviors in the sucrose preference and 
forced swim tests. Surprisingly, in PENK KO mice, we did not detect anxiety and 
depression-related behavioral changes after the CMS procedure, and even measured 
a decreased hormonal stress response. These results indicate that PENK KO mice 
are resistant to the CMS effects, suggesting that enkephalin enhances the 
reactivity to chronic stress.

A number of studies demonstrated a rapid onset of an antidepressant effect of 
non-competitive N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) antagonists. 
Nonetheless, its therapeutic potential is rather limited, due to a high 
coincidence of negative side-effects. Therefore, the challenge seems to be in 
the development of NMDAR antagonists displaying antidepressant properties, and 
at the same time maintaining regular physiological function of the NMDAR. 
Previous results demonstrated that naturally occurring neurosteroid 
3α5β-pregnanolone sulfate shows pronounced inhibitory action by a use-dependent 
mechanism on the tonically active NMDAR. The aim of the present experiments is 
to find out whether the treatment with pregnanolone 3αC derivatives affects 
behavioral response to chronic and acute stress in an animal model of 
depression. Adult male mice were used throughout the study. Repeated social 
defeat and forced swimming tests were used as animal models of depression. The 
effect of the drugs on the locomotor/exploratory activity in the open-field test 
was also tested together with an effect on anxiety in the elevated plus maze. 
Results showed that pregnanolone glutamate (PG) did not induce hyperlocomotion, 
whereas both dizocilpine and ketamine significantly increased spontaneous 
locomotor activity in the open field. In the elevated plus maze, PG displayed 
anxiolytic-like properties. In forced swimming, PG prolonged time to the first 
floating. Acute treatment of PG disinhibited suppressed locomotor activity in 
the repeatedly defeated group-housed mice. Aggressive behavior of isolated mice 
was reduced after the chronic 30-day administration of PG. PG showed 
antidepressant-like and anxiolytic-like properties in the used tests, with 
minimal side-effects. Since PG combines GABAA receptor potentiation and 
use-dependent NMDAR inhibition, synthetic derivatives of neuroactive steroids 
present a promising strategy for the treatment of mood disorders.
HIGHLIGHTS: -3α5β-pregnanolone glutamate (PG) is a use-dependent antagonist of 
NMDA receptors.-We demonstrated that PG did not induce significant 
hyperlocomotion.-We showed that PG displayed anxiolytic-like and 
antidepressant-like properties.

Impairment of serotonergic neurotransmission is the major factor responsible for 
depression and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) participates in serotonergic 
transmission-mediated signaling networks relevant to mental illnesses. In the 
forced-swim test to assess depression-like behavior, the immobility time for 
mice with restraint stress was significantly longer than that for nonstressed 
control mice. Postsynaptic cell surface localization of 5-HT1A receptor, but not 
5-HT2A receptor, in the hypothalamus for mice with restraint stress was 
significantly reduced as compared with that for control mice, which highly 
correlated to prolonged immobility time, i.e., depression-like behavior. The 
linoleic acid derivative 8-[2-(2-pentyl-cyclopropylmethyl)-cyclopropyl]-octanoic 
acid (DCP-LA) restored restraint stress-induced reduction of cell surface 5-HT1A 
receptor and improved depression-like behavior in mice with restraint stress. 
Moreover, DCP-LA stimulated serotonin release from hypothalamic slices and 
cancelled restraint stress-induced reduction of GSK-3β phosphorylation at Ser9. 
Taken together, the results of the present study indicate that DCP-LA could 
ameliorate depression-like behavior by promoting translocation of 5-HT1A 
receptor to the plasma membrane on postsynaptic cells, stimulating serotonin 
release, and inactivating GSK-3β.

Stimulation of high oxidative stress in the brain is considered as an important 
factor for neurotoxicity towards the pathophysiology of chronic stress-induced 
depression disorder. In the present research, a potential 5-HT₃ receptor 
antagonist N-n-butyl-3-methoxy quinoxaline-2-carboxamide (6o) having good Log P 
(2.60) and pA₂ (7.7) values was examined for its effect on the behavioral and 
biochemical changes induced by the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) 
model. In the current investigation mice were introduced to different stress 
procedures daily for a period of 28 days to induce a depressive-like behavior. 
The results show that CUMS caused a depression-like behavior in mice, as 
indicated by the significant decrease in sucrose consumption and locomotor 
activity and increase in immobility in the forced swim test (FST). Moreover, it 
was found that oxidative stress markers such as lipid peroxide and nitrite 
levels were significantly increased, whereas, antioxidant enzymes such as 
glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) levels were 
decreased in the brain tissue of CUMS-subjected mice. "Compound 6o" (1 and 2 
mg/kg, p.o.) and fluoxetine treatment (20 mg/kg, p.o.) for a period of 21 days 
altered the CUMS-induced behavioral (increased immobility period, reduced 
sucrose preference and decreased locomotor activity) and biochemical (increased 
lipid peroxide, increased brain nitrite; decreased GSH, SOD and CAT levels) 
alterations. Moreover normal mice treated with "compound 6o" (2 mg/kg, p.o.) 
showed a significant decrease in the duration of immobility in FST as compared 
to normal vehicle treated mice. In conclusion, "compound 6o" produced 
antidepressant-like effects in behavioral despair paradigm in chronically 
stressed mice by restoring antioxidant enzyme activity.

Augmenting hippocampal neurogenesis represents a potential new strategy for 
treating depression. Here we test this possibility by comparing hippocampal 
neurogenesis in depression-prone ghrelin receptor (Ghsr)-null mice to that in 
wild-type littermates and by determining the antidepressant efficacy of the P7C3 
class of neuroprotective compounds. Exposure of Ghsr-null mice to chronic social 
defeat stress (CSDS) elicits more severe depressive-like behavior than in 
CSDS-exposed wild-type littermates, and exposure of Ghsr-null mice to 60% 
caloric restriction fails to elicit antidepressant-like behavior. CSDS resulted 
in more severely reduced cell proliferation and survival in the ventral dentate 
gyrus (DG) subgranular zone of Ghsr-null mice than in that of wild-type 
littermates. Also, caloric restriction increased apoptosis of DG subgranular 
zone cells in Ghsr-null mice, although it had the opposite effect in wild-type 
littermates. Systemic treatment with P7C3 during CSDS increased survival of 
proliferating DG cells, which ultimately developed into mature (NeuN+) neurons. 
Notably, P7C3 exerted a potent antidepressant-like effect in Ghsr-null mice 
exposed to either CSDS or caloric restriction, while the more highly active 
analog P7C3-A20 also exerted an antidepressant-like effect in wild-type 
littermates. Focal ablation of hippocampal stem cells with radiation eliminated 
this antidepressant effect, further attributing the P7C3 class antidepressant 
effect to its neuroprotective properties and resultant augmentation of 
hippocampal neurogenesis. Finally, P7C3-A20 demonstrated greater proneurogenic 
efficacy than a wide spectrum of currently marketed antidepressant drugs. Taken 
together, our data confirm the role of aberrant hippocampal neurogenesis in the 
etiology of depression and suggest that the neuroprotective P7C3-compounds 
represent a novel strategy for treating patients with this disease.

Maca has been consumed as a medical food in Peru for thousands of years, and 
exerts anxiolytic and antidepressant effects. Our present study aimed to 
evaluate the behavior and anatomical and biochemical effects of petroleum ether 
extract from maca (ME) in the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model of 
depression in mice. Three different doses of maca extract (125, 250, and 
500 mg/kg) were orally administrated in the six-week CUMS procedure. Fluoxetine 
(10 mg/kg) was used as a positive control drug. Maca extract (250 and 500 mg/kg) 
significantly decreased the duration of immobility time in the tail suspension 
test. After treatment with maca extract (250 and 500 mg/kg), the granule cell 
layer in the dentate gyrus appeared thicker. Maca extract (250 and 500 mg/kg) 
also induced a significant reduction in corticosterone levels in mouse serum. In 
mouse brain tissue, after six weeks of treatment, noradrenaline and dopamine 
levels were increased by maca extract, and the activity of reactive oxygen 
species was significantly inhibited. Serotonin levels were not significantly 
altered. These results demonstrated that maca extract (250 and 500 mg/kg) showed 
antidepressant-like effects and was related to the activation of both 
noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems, as well as attenuation of oxidative 
stress in mouse brain.

Opioid and glutamatergic receptors have a key role in depression following 
stress. In this study, we assessed opioid and glutamatergic receptors 
interaction with the depressant-like behavior of acute foot-shock stress in the 
mouse forced swimming test. Stress was induced by intermittent foot shock 
stimulation during 30min and swim periods were afterwards conducted by placing 
mice in separated glass cylinders filled with water for 6min. The immobility 
time during the last 4min of the test was considered. Acute foot-shock stress 
significantly increased the immobility time of mice compared to non-stressed 
control group (P≤0.01). Administration of non-selective opioid receptors 
antagonist, naltrexone (1 and 2mg/kg, i.p.), and the selective non-competitive 
NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801 (0.05mg/kg, i.p.), and the selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine (5mg/kg), significantly reduced the immobility 
time in stressed animals (P≤0.01). Lower doses of MK-801 (0.01mg/kg), naltrexone 
(0.3mg/kg), NMDA (75mg/kg) and morphine(5mg/kg) had no effect on foot-shock 
stressed mice. Combined treatment of sub-effective doses of naltrexone and 
MK-801 significantly showed an antidepressant-like effect (P≤0.001). On the 
other hand, co-administration of non-effective doses of NMDA and morphine with 
effective doses of naltrexone and MK-801 reversed the anti-immobility effect of 
these drugs. Taken together, we have for the first time demonstrated the 
possible role of opioid/NMDA receptors signaling in the depressant-like effect 
of foot-shock stress, and proposed the use of drugs that act like standard 
anti-depressants in stress-induced depression.

Resveratrol (3,4',5-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) is a natural non-flavonoid 
polyphenol antioxidant extracted from red grapes in the processing of wine. 
Initially it was studied for its potential as anticancer drug, and later was 
found to reduce cardiovascular disease. More recently resveratrol was shown to 
alleviate depressive-like symptoms induced by stress or other means in mice and 
rats. The major purpose of this study was to investigate whether resveratrol 
would manifest an antidepressant effect in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, a putative 
and non-induced animal model of depression, and whether this effect might be 
associated with an increase in hippocampal and frontal cortical brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein implicated in chronic effects of many 
antidepressants. Adult male WKY rats were injected with two doses of resveratrol 
(10 and 40 mg/kg, i.p.) and their behavior in the open field locomotor activity 
(LMA), forced swim test (FST: a measure of helplessness), and sucrose preference 
test (SPT: a measure of anhedonia) was evaluated after a single acute injection 
or following 7 days of daily treatment. Both acute and chronic administration of 
resveratrol resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in FST. However, only chronic 
resveratrol resulted in dose-dependent increase in sucrose consumption. LMA was 
not affected by any treatment. Parallel to the observed behavioral effects the 
level of hippocampal, but not frontal cortical, BDNF was also dose-dependently 
elevated after chronic resveratrol administration. These findings indicate an 
antidepressant-like effect of resveratrol in an animal model of depression 
possibly via activation of hippocampal BDNF, and suggest therapeutic potential 
of resveratrol in at least a subpopulation of depressed patients.

Chronic stress underlies and/or exacerbates many psychiatric conditions and 
often results in memory impairment as well as depressive symptoms. Such 
afflicted individuals use tobacco more than the general population and this has 
been suggested as a form of self-medication. Cotinine, the predominant 
metabolite of nicotine, may underlie such behavior as it has been shown to 
ameliorate anxiety and memory loss in animal models. In this study, we sought to 
investigate the effects of cotinine on working memory and depressive-like 
behavior in mice subjected to prolonged restraint. Cotinine-treated mice 
displayed better performance than vehicle-treated cohorts on the working memory 
task, the radial arm water maze test. In addition, with or without chronic 
stress exposure, cotinine-treated mice engaged in fewer depressive-like 
behaviors as assessed using the tail suspension and Porsolt's forced swim tests. 
These antidepressant and nootropic effects of cotinine were associated with an 
increase in the synaptophysin expression, a commonly used marker of synaptic 
density, in the hippocampus as well as the prefrontal and entorhinal cortices of 
restrained mice. The beneficial effects of cotinine in preventing various 
consequences of chronic stress were underscored by the inhibition of the 
glycogen synthase kinase 3 β in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Taken 
together, our results show for the first time that cotinine reduces the negative 
effects of stress on mood, memory, and the synapse.

Effect of (4a) a novel 5-HT3 receptor antagonist on chronic unpredictable mild 
stress induced depressive-like behavior in mice: an approach using behavioral 
tests battery.

Kurhe Y, Mahesh R, Gupta D, Thangaraj D.

BACKGROUND: The inconsistent therapeutic outcome necessitates designing and 
identifying novel therapeutic interventions for depression. Hence, the present 
study deals with the investigation of antidepressant-like effects of a novel 
5-HT3 receptor antagonist (4-phenylpiperazin-1-yl) (quinoxalin-2-yl) methanone 
(4a) on chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) induced behavioral and 
biochemical alterations.
METHODS: Animals were subjected to different stressors for a period of 28 days. 
On day 15 after the subsequent stress procedure, mice were administered with 
(4a) (2 and 4 mg/kg p.o.), escitalopram (10 mg/kg p.o.), or vehicle (10 mL/kg 
p.o.) until day 28 along with the CUMS. Thereafter, behavioral battery tests 
like locomotor score, sucrose preference test, forced swim test (FST), tail 
suspension test (TST), and elevated plus maze (EPM) were performed. Biochemical 
assays like lipid peroxidation, nitrite levels, reduced glutathione (GSH), 
catalase, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were estimated in the mice brain 
homogenate.
RESULTS: (4a) Dose dependently attenuated the behavioral alterations by 
increasing the sucrose consumption, reducing the immobility time in FST and TST, 
increasing the open arm number of entries and time in EPM. Furthermore, 
biochemical alterations were reversed by (4a) as examined by reduced lipid 
peroxidation and nitrite levels and elevated antioxidant enzyme levels like GSH, 
catalase and SOD.
CONCLUSIONS: (4a) exhibits antidepressant potential by reversing the CUMS 
induced behavioral and biochemical changes in mice.

Glucocorticoid receptor deletion from the dorsal raphé nucleus of mice reduces 
dysphoria-like behavior and impairs hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis 
feedback inhibition.

Glucocorticoids can cause depression and anxiety. Mechanisms for glucocorticoid 
effects on mood are largely undefined. The dorsal raphé nucleus (DRN) produces 
the majority of serotonin in the brain, and expresses glucocorticoid receptors 
(GR). Because we previously showed that antidepressants used to treat depression 
and anxiety decrease DRN GR expression, we hypothesized that deleting DRN GR 
would have anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects. We also hypothesized 
that DRN GR deletion would disinhibit activity of the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Adeno-associated virus pseudotype 
AAV2/9 expressing either Cre recombinase (DRNGRKO mice) or GFP (DRN-GFP mice) 
was injected into the DRN of floxed GR mice to test these hypotheses. Three 
weeks after injection, mice underwent 21 days of social defeat or control 
handling and were tested for anxiety-like behavior (open-field test, 
elevated-plus maze), depression-like behavior [sucrose preference, forced-swim 
test (FST), tail-suspension test (TST)], social interaction, and circadian and 
stress-induced HPA activity. DRN GR deletion decreased anxiety-like behavior in 
control but not in defeated mice. DRN GR deletion decreased FST and tended to 
decrease TST despair-like behavior in both control and defeated mice, but did 
not affect sucrose preference. Exploration of social (a novel mouse) as well as 
neutral (an empty box) targets was increased in DRNGRKO mice, suggesting that 
DRN GR deletion also promotes active coping. DRN GR deletion increased 
stress-induced HPA activity without strongly altering circadian HPA activity. We 
have shown a novel role for DRN GR to mediate anxiety- and despair-like behavior 
and to regulate HPA negative feedback during acute stress.

Inflammation, oxidative and nitrosative stress underlie depression being 
assessed in rodents by the systemic administration of lipopolysacharide (LPS). 
There is an increasing body of evidence of an involvement of nitric oxide (NO) 
pathway in depression, but this issue was not investigated in LPS-induced model. 
Thus, herein we evaluated the effects of NO-pathway-modulating drugs, named 
aminoguanidine, l-NAME, sildenafil and l-arginine, on the behavioral (forced 
swimming test [FST], sucrose preference [SPT] and prepulse inhibition [PPI] of 
the startle) and neurochemical (glutathione [GSH], lipid peroxidation, IL-1β) 
alterations in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum as well as in 
BDNF levels in the hippocampus 24h after LPS (0.5mg/kg, i.p.) administration, a 
time-point related to depressive-like behavior. Twenty-four hours post LPS there 
was an increase in immobility time in the FST, decrease in sucrose preference 
and PPI levels accompanied by a decrease in GSH levels and an increase in lipid 
peroxidation, IL-1β and hippocampal BDNF levels suggestive of a depressive-like 
state. The pretreatment with the NOS inhibitors, l-NAME and aminoguanidine as 
well as sildenafil prevented the behavioral and neurochemical alterations 
induced by LPS, although sildenafil and l-NAME were not able to prevent the 
increase in hippocampal BDNF levels induced by LPS. The iNOS inhibitor, 
aminoguanidine, and imipramine prevented all behavioral and neurochemical 
alterations induced by LPS. l-arginine did not prevent the alterations in 
immobility time, sucrose preference and GSH induced by LPS. Taken together our 
results show that the NO-cGMP pathway is important in the modulation of the 
depressive-like alterations induced by LPS.

Smoking is frequently co-morbid with depression. Although it is recognized that 
depression increases the risk for smoking, it is unclear if early smoking 
exposure may increase the risk for depression. To test this possibility we 
assessed the effects of adolescent nicotine exposure on the Forced Swim Test 
(FST), which is used as a measure of passive coping, and depressive-like 
behavior in rodents, and on the open field test (OFT), which is used as a 
measure of locomotion and exploratory behavior. Male and female mice received 
daily saline or nicotine (0.3 or 0.6 mg/kg) injections from postnatal day (PD) 
30 to PD 44. FST and OFT were performed either 1 or 30 days after the last 
injection (PD 45 and PD 74, respectively). In females, treatment with 0.3 mg/kg 
nicotine lead to increased FST immobility (64%) and decreased OFT locomotor 
activity (12%) one day following the last nicotine injection (PD 45); while no 
effects were observed in adulthood (PD 74). In contrast, on PD45, nicotine 
treatment did not change the male FST immobility but lead to lower OFT locomotor 
activity (0.6 mg/kg, 10%). In adulthood (PD 74), both nicotine doses lead to 
higher FST immobility (87%) in males while 0.6 mg/kg nicotine to lower OFT 
locomotor activity (13%). The results (i) identify females as more vulnerable to 
the immediate withdrawal that follows nicotine discontinuation in adolescence 
and (ii) suggest that adolescent nicotine exposure may enhance the risk for 
passive response towards unavoidable stress in adult males.

Major depression is a complex disorder characterized by genetic and 
environmental interactions. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) 
effectively treat depression. Neurogenesis following chronic antidepressant 
treatment activates brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling. In this 
study, we analyzed the effects of the SSRI fluvoxamine (Flu) on locomotor 
activity and forced-swim behavior using chronic dexamethasone (cDEX) infusions 
in mice, which engenders depression-like behavior. Infusion of cDEX decreased 
body weight and produced a trend towards lower locomotor activity during 
darkness. In the forced-swim test, cDEX-mice exhibited increased immobility 
times compared with mice administered saline. Flu treatment reversed decreased 
locomotor activity and mitigated forced-swim test immobility. Real-time 
polymerase chain reactions using brain RNA samples yielded significantly lower 
BDNF mRNA levels in cDEX-mice compared with the saline group. Endoplasmic 
reticulum stress-associated X-box binding protein-1 (XBP1) gene expression was 
lower in cDEX-mice compared with the saline group. However, marked expression of 
the XBP1 gene was observed in cDEX-mice treated with Flu compared with mice 
given saline and untreated cDEX-mice. Expression of 5-HT2A and Sigma-1 receptors 
decreased after cDEX infusion compared with the saline group, and these 
decreases normalized to control levels upon Flu treatment. Our results indicate 
that the Flu moderates reductions in voluntary activity following chronic 
dexamethasone infusions in mice via recovery of BDNF signal cascades.

Radix Polygalae (the root of Polygala tenuifolia) is a herb widely used in 
traditional Asian medicine that is thought to exert a variety of 
neuropsychiatric effects. Radix Polygalae extract can protect against N-methyl 
D-aspartate (NMDA) neurotoxicity and induce brain-derived neurotrophic factor 
(BDNF) expression, suggesting modulatory roles at glutamatergic synapses and 
possible antidepressant action. In accordance with this hypothesis, Radix 
Polygalae extract demonstrated antidepressant-like effects in 8-week-old male 
C57Bl/6 mice by decreasing behavioral despair in the forced swim and tail 
suspension tasks and increasing hedonic-like behavior in the female urine 
sniffing test 30 minutes after a single oral administration of 0.1 mg/kg. 
Reduced latency to acquire a food pellet in the novely suppressed feeding 
paradigm, without change in anxiety-like behaviors suggested a rapid-onset 
nature of the antidepressant-like effect. In addition, it decreased the number 
of failed escapes in the learned helplessness paradigm after two oral 
administrations 24 hours and 30 minutes before the first test. Finally, it 
reversed anhedonia as measured by saccharin preference in mice exposed to the 
chronic stress model after two administrations of 0.1 mg/kg, in contrast to the 
repeated administration generally needed for similar effect by monoamergic 
antidepressants. Immobility reduction in tail suspension task was blocked by the 
α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist 
NBQX, a pattern previously demonstrated by ketamine and other ketamine-like 
rapid-onset antidepressants. Also similarly to ketamine, Radix Polygalae 
appeared to acutely decrease phosphorylation of GluR1 serine-845 in the 
hippocampus while leaving the phosphorylation of hippocampal mTOR serine 2448 
unchanged. These findings serve as preclinical evidence that Radix Polygalae 
extract exerts rapid-onset antidepressant effects by modulating glutamatergic 
synapses in critical brain circuits of depression and may be worthy of further 
evaluation as a safe substitute to other rapid-onset antidepressants known to 
have unacceptable side effects.

Hippocampal dysfunctions in tumor-bearing mice.

Yang M, Kim J, Kim JS, Kim SH, Kim JC, Kang MJ, Jung U, Shin T, Wang H, Moon C.

Individuals with cancer are particularly susceptible to depression and cognitive 
impairment. However, the precise mechanisms underlying cancer-induced 
hippocampal dysfunction are poorly understood. We investigated the effects of a 
peripheral tumor on emotional behavior, hippocampus-dependent memory and 
associated molecular and cellular features using an experimental animal model. 
Behavioral alterations were examined; stress-related parameters measured; 
hippocampal neurogenesis evaluated; and the levels of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) 
assayed, 2 weeks after inoculation of adult BALB/c mice with cells of a colon 
carcinoma cell line (CT26). As the tumors developed, CT26-inoculated mice showed 
significant increases in the depression-like behavior (measured using the tail 
suspension test) and memory impairment (in terms of object recognition) compared 
with vehicle-inoculated controls. The presence of a peripheral tumor 
significantly elevated the hippocampal levels of mRNAs encoding interleukin-6 
(IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α, as well as plasma IL-6 and corticosterone 
levels. Additionally, the adrenal glands became enlarged, and the numbers of 
Ki-67-positive proliferating hippocampal cells and doublecortin-positive 
immature progenitor neurons, as well as the constitutive levels of mRNAs 
encoding BDNF and COX-2 were significantly reduced. Therefore, a peripheral 
tumor alone may be sufficient to induce hippocampal dysfunction, possibly by 
reducing the rate of neurogenesis and the levels of BDNF and COX-2 in that 
tissue and also by increasing stress-related parameters and the circulating 
levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

Lithium, a mood stabilizer, is known to ameliorate the stress-induced decrease 
in hippocampal neurogenesis seen in animal models of stress-related disorders. 
However, it is unclear whether lithium has beneficial effect on neuronal repair 
following neuronal damage in neuronal degenerative diseases. Here, we evaluated 
the effect of in vivo treatment with lithium on the hippocampal neuronal repair 
in a mouse model of trimethyltin (TMT)-induced neuronal loss/self-repair in the 
hippocampal dentate gyrus (such mice referred to as "impaired animals") [Ogita 
et al. (2005) J Neurosci Res 82: 609-621]. The impaired animals had a 
dramatically increased number of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-incorporating 
cells in their dentate gyrus at the initial time window (days 3 to 5 post-TMT 
treatment) of the self-repair stage. A single treatment with lithium produced no 
significant change in the number of BrdU-incorporating cells in the dentate 
granule cell layer and subgranular zone on day 3 post-TMT treatment. On day 5 
post-TMT treatment, however, BrdU-incorporating cells were significantly 
increased in number by lithium treatment for 3 days. Most interestingly, chronic 
treatment (15 days) with lithium increased the number of BrdU-incorporating 
cells positive for NeuN or doublecortin in the dentate granule cell layer of the 
impaired animals, but not in that of naïve animals. The results of a forced 
swimming test revealed that the chronic treatment with lithium improved the 
depression-like behavior seen in the impaired animals. Taken together, our data 
suggest that lithium had a beneficial effect on neuronal repair following 
neuronal loss in the dentate gyrus through promoted proliferation and 
survival/neuronal differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells in the 
subgranular zone.

Women exhibit a nearly twofold increased risk of developing depression and 
anxiety disorders when compared to men, a fact that has been hypothesized to 
result in part from increased stress susceptibility. Here, we used the 
tryptophan hydroxylase-2 R439H knock-in mouse (Tph2KI) and the chronic 
unpredictable mild stress (CMS) model to examine sex differences in response to 
congenital 5-HT deficiency and chronic stress. Our results demonstrate that 
female mice, but not 5-HT-deficient animals, exhibit significantly increased 
susceptibility to CMS-induced despair-like behavior in the forced swim test. In 
addition, female 5-HT-deficient mice exhibit anhedonia-like behavior in the 
sucrose preference test, whereas male 5-HT-deficient animals do not, suggesting 
that females exhibit increased sensitivity to at least some of the effects of 
congenital 5-HT deficiency. Although CMS did not reduce cell proliferation in 
the hippocampus, low levels of brain 5-HT were associated with increased 
hippocampal cell proliferation, an effect that was predominantly observed in 
females. Overall, these results highlight the importance of interactions between 
psychiatric disease risk factors such as sex, chronic stress and congenital 5-HT 
deficiency in the development of aberrant emotional behavior.

Agmatine has been recently emerged as a novel candidate to assist the 
conventional pharmacotherapy of depression. The acute restraint stress (ARS) is 
an unavoidable stress situation that may cause depressive-like behavior in 
rodents. In this study, we investigated the potential antidepressant-like effect 
of agmatine (10mg/kg, administered acutely by oral route) in the forced swimming 
test (FST) in non-stressed mice, as well as its ability to abolish the 
depressive-like behavior and hippocampal antioxidant imbalance induced by ARS. 
Agmatine reduced the immobility time in the mouse FST (1-100mg/kg) in 
non-stressed mice. ARS caused an increase in the immobility time in the FST, 
indicative of a depressive-like behavior, as well as hippocampal lipid 
peroxidation, and an increase in the activity of hippocampal superoxide 
dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR) 
activities, reduced catalase (CAT) activity and increased SOD/CAT ratio, an 
index of pro-oxidative conditions. Agmatine was effective to abolish the 
depressive-like behavior induced by ARS and to prevent the ARS-induced lipid 
peroxidation and changes in SOD, GR and CAT activities and in SOD/CAT activity 
ratio. Hippocampal levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) were not altered by any 
experimental condition. In conclusion, the present study shows that agmatine was 
able to abrogate the ARS-induced depressive-like behavior and the associated 
redox hippocampal imbalance observed in stressed restraint mice, suggesting that 
its antidepressant-like effect may be dependent on its ability to maintain the 
pro-/anti-oxidative homeostasis in the hippocampus.

Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that piperine produced 
antidepressant-like action in various mouse models of behavioral despair. This 
study aimed to investigate the role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) 
signalling in the antidepressant-like effect of piperine in mice exposed to 
chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). The results showed that CUMS caused 
depression-like behavior in mice, as indicated by the significant decrease in 
sucrose consumption and increase in immobility time in the forced swim test. It 
was also found that BDNF protein expression in the hippocampus and frontal 
cortex were significantly decreased in CUMS-treated mice. Chronic treatment of 
piperine at the dose of 10mg/kg significantly ameliorated behavioural deficits 
of CUMS-treated mice in the sucrose preference test and forced swim test. 
Piperine treatment also significantly decreased immobility time in the forced 
swim test in naive mice. In parallel, chronic piperine treatment significantly 
increased BDNF protein expression in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of both 
naive and CUMS-treated mice. In addition, inhibition of BDNF signalling by 
injection of K252a, an inhibitor of the BDNF receptor TrkB, significantly 
blocked the antidepressant-like effect of piperine in the sucrose preference 
test and forced swim test of CUMS-treated mice. Taken together, this study 
suggests that BDNF signalling is an essential mediator for the 
antidepressant-like effect of piperine.

There is converging evidence that prenatal maternal infection can increase the 
risk of occurrence of neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia, autism, 
anxiety and depression in later life. Experimental studies have shown 
conflicting effects of prenatal maternal immune activation on anxiety-like 
behavior and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis development in offspring. 
We investigated the effects of maternal immune activation during pregnancy on 
anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in pregnant mice and their offspring to 
determine whether these effects are dependent on strain. NMRI and C57BL/6 
pregnant mice were treated with either saline or lipopolysaccharide on 
gestational day 17 and then interleukin (IL)-6 and corticosterone (COR) levels; 
anxiety or depression in the pregnant mice and their offspring were evaluated. 
The results indicate that maternal inflammation increased the levels of COR and 
anxiety-like behavior in NMRI pregnant mice, but not in C57BL/6 dams. Our data 
also demonstrate that maternal inflammation elevated the levels of anxiety-and 
depression-like behaviors in NMRI offspring on the elevated plus-maze, elevated 
zero-maze, tail suspension test and forced swimming test respectively, but not 
in the open field and light-dark box. In addition, we did not find any 
significant change in anxiety- and depression-like behaviors of adult C57BL/6 
offspring. Our findings suggest that prenatal maternal immune activation can 
alter the HPA axis activity, anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in a strain- 
and task-dependent manner in offspring and further comprehensive studies are 
needed to prove the causal relationship between the findings found here and to 
validate their relevance to neuropsychiatric disorders in humans.

Blocking, desensitizing, or knocking out transient receptor potential vanilloid 
type 1 (TRPV1) receptors decreases immobility in the forced swim test, a measure 
of depressive behavior. We questioned whether enhancing TRPV1 activity promotes 
immobility in a fashion that is prevented by antidepressants. To test this we 
activated heat-sensitive TRPV1 receptors in mice by water that is warmer than 
body temperature (41 °C) or a low dose of resiniferatoxin (RTX). Water at 41 °C 
elicited less immobility than cooler water (26 °C), indicating that 
thermoregulatory sites do not contribute to immobility. Although a desensitizing 
regimen of RTX (3-5 injections of 0.1 mg/kg s.c.) decreased immobility during 
swims at 26 °C, it did not during swims at 41 °C. In contrast, low dose of RTX 
(0.02 mg/kg s.c.) enhanced immobility, but only during swims at 41 °C. Thus, 
activation of TRPV1 receptors, endogenously or exogenously, enhances immobility 
and these sites are activated by cold rather than warmth. Two distinct types of 
antidepressants, amitriptyline (10mg/kg i.p.) and ketamine (50 mg/kg i.p.), each 
inhibited the increase in immobility induced by the low dose of RTX, verifying 
its mediation by TRPV1 sites. When desensitization was limited to central 
populations using intrathecal injections of RTX (0.25 μg/kg i.t.), immobility 
was attenuated at both temperatures and the increase in immobility produced by 
the low dose of RTX was inhibited. This demonstrates a role for central TRPV1 
receptors in depressive behavior, activated by conditions (cold stress) distinct 
from those that activate TRPV1 receptors along thermosensory afferents (heat).

Chronic stress exposure and resulting dysregulation of the hypothalamic 
pituitary adrenal axis develops susceptibility to variety of neurological and 
psychiatric disorders. Agmatine, a putative neurotransmitter has been reported 
to be released in response to various stressful stimuli to maintain the 
homeostasis. Present study investigated the role of agmatine on chronic 
unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) induced behavioral and biochemical alteration 
in mice. Exposure of mice to CUMS protocol for 28 days resulted in diminished 
performance in sucrose preference test, splash test, forced swim test and marked 
elevation in plasma corticosterone levels. Chronic agmatine (5 and 10 mg/kg, ip, 
once daily) treatment started on day-15 and continued till the end of the CUMS 
protocol significantly increased sucrose preference, improved self-care and 
motivational behavior in the splash test and decreased duration of immobility in 
the forced swim test. Agmatine treatment also normalized the elevated 
corticosterone levels and prevented the body weight changes in chronically 
stressed animals. The pharmacological effect of agmatine was comparable to 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine (10mg/kg, ip). Results of 
present study clearly demonstrated the anti-depressant like effect of agmatine 
in chronic unpredictable mild stress induced depression in mice. Thus the 
development of drugs based on brain agmatinergic modulation may represent a new 
potential approach for the treatment of stress related mood disorders like 
depression.

OBJECTIVES: The inconsistent therapeutic outcome necessitates identifying novel 
compounds for the treatment of depression. Therefore, the present study is aimed 
at evaluating the antidepressant-like effects of a novel 5-HT3 receptor 
antagonist 3-methoxy-N-p-tolylquinoxalin-2-carboxamide (QCM-4) on chronic 
unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) induced behavioral and biochemical alterations 
in mice.
METHODS: Animals were subjected to different stressors for a period of 28 days. 
Thereafter, battery tests like locomotor score, sucrose preference test, forced 
swim test (FST), tail suspension test (TST), elevated plus maze (EPM) and open 
field test (OFT) were performed. Biochemical assays like lipid peroxidation, 
nitrite levels, reduced glutathione (GSH), catalase and superoxide dismutase 
(SOD) were assessed in brain homogenate.
KEY FINDINGS: QCM-4 dose dependently reversed the CUMS induced behavioral and 
biochemical alterations by increasing the sucrose consumption, reducing the 
immobility time in FST and TST, increasing the percent time in open arm in EPM 
and increasing the ambulation along with the rearings and decreased number of 
fecal pellets in OFT. Further, biochemical alterations were attenuated by QCM-4 
as indicated by reduced lipid peroxidation and nitrite levels and elevated 
antioxidant enzyme levels like GSH, catalase and SOD.
CONCLUSIONS: QCM-4 attenuated the behavioral and biochemical derangements 
induced by CUMS in mice, indicating antidepressant behavior of the novel 
compound.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by progressive dopamine (DA) depletion 
in the striatum. Exercise has been shown to be a promising non-pharmacological 
approach to reduce the risk of neurodegeneration diseases. This study was 
designed to investigate the potential neuroprotective effect of swimming 
training (ST) in a mouse model of PD induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in 
mice. The present study demonstrated that a 4-week ST was effective in 
attenuating the following impairments resulting from 6-OHDA exposure: (i) 
depressive-like behavior in the tail suspension test; (ii) increase in the 
number of falls in the rotarod test; (iii) impairment on long-term memory in the 
object recognition test; (iv) increase of the reactive species and interleukin 
1-beta (IL-1β) levels; (v) inhibition of the glutathione peroxidase (GPx) 
activity; (vi) rise of the glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione 
S-transferase (GST) activities and vii) decrease of DA, homovanillic acid (HVA) 
and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) levels. The mechanisms involved in 
this study are the modulation of GPx, GR and GST activities as well as IL-1β 
level in a PD model induced by 6-OHDA, protecting against the decrease of DA, 
DOPAC and HVA levels in the striatum of mice. These findings reinforce that one 
of the effects induced by exercise on neurodegenerative disease, such as PD, is 
due to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. We suggest that exercise 
attenuates cognitive and motor declines, depression, oxidative stress, and 
neuroinflammation induced by 6-OHDA supporting the hypothesis that exercise can 
be used as a non-pharmacological tool to reduce the symptoms of PD.

It has been demonstrated that the translocator protein (18 kDa) (TSPO) plays an 
important role in stress-response and stress-related disorders, such as anxiety 
and depression, by affecting the production of neurosteroids, supporting the 
potential use of selective TSPO ligands as antidepressant or anxiolytic drugs. 
N-ethyl-N-(2-pyridinylmethyl)- 2-(3,4-ichlorophenyl)- 7-methylimidazo [1,2-a] 
pyridine-3-acetamide hydrochloride (YL-IPA08), a novel TSPO ligand that has been 
synthesized at our institute, exerted a high affinity for TSPO in a crude 
mitochondrial fraction prepared from rat cerebellum but exhibited only a 
negligible affinity for the central benzodiazepine receptor. As expected, 
YL-IPA08 incubation with the cultured rat astrocyte cells increased the 
pregnenolone and progesterone concentration from the cultured medium. Moreover, 
YL-IPA08 produced significant antidepressant-like and anxiolytic-like effects in 
a series of mouse and rat behavior models. In addition, the antidepressant-like 
behavior of YL-IPA08 was totally blocked by the TSPO antagonist PK11195 in a 
tail suspension test, and the anxiolytic effect was blocked by PK11195 but not 
by a CBR antagonist in the elevated plus-maze test. Furthermore, compared with 
the CBR agonist diazepam, YL-IPA08 had no myorelaxant effects and did not affect 
the motor coordination, memory or hexobarbitone-induced sleep in mice. Overall, 
these results indicate that YL-IPA08 is a more potent and selective TSPO ligand, 
which exerts antidepressant-like and anxiolytic-like effects on behaviors that 
are mediated by TSPO but does not cause the side effects that are typically 
associated with conventional benzodiazepines.

Repetitive concussive traumatic brain injury interacts with post-injury foot 
shock stress to worsen social and depression-like behavior in mice.

The debilitating effects of repetitive concussive traumatic brain injury (rcTBI) 
have been increasingly recognized in both military and civilian populations. 
rcTBI may result in significant neurological, cognitive, and affective sequelae, 
and is often followed by physical and/or psychological post-injury stressors 
that may exacerbate the effects of the injury and prolong the recovery period 
for injured patients. However, the consequences of post-injury stressors and 
their subsequent effects on social and emotional behavior in the context of 
rcTBI have been relatively little studied in animal models. Here, we use a mouse 
model of rcTBI with two closed-skull blunt impacts 24 hours apart and social and 
emotional behavior testing to examine the consequences of a stressor (foot shock 
fear conditioning) following brain injury (rcTBI). rcTBI alone did not affect 
cued or contextual fear conditioning or extinction compared to uninjured sham 
animals. In the sucrose preference test, rcTBI animals had decreased preference 
for sucrose, an anhedonia-like behavior, regardless of whether they experienced 
foot shock stress or were non-shocked controls. However, rcTBI and post-injury 
foot shock stress had synergistic effects in tests of social recognition and 
depression-like behavior. In the social recognition test, animals with both 
injury and shock were more impaired than either non-shocked injured mice or 
shocked but uninjured mice. In the tail suspension test, injured mice had 
increased depression-like behavior compared with uninjured mice, and shock 
stress worsened the depression-like behavior only in the injured mice with no 
effect in the uninjured mice. These results provide a model of subtle emotional 
behavioral deficits after combined concussive brain injury and stress, and may 
provide a platform for testing treatment and prevention strategies for social 
behavior deficits and mood disorders that are tailored to patients with 
traumatic brain injury.

Preliminary study in our laboratory showed that etazolate produced 
antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects in rodent models, however, the 
ability of etazolate to produce antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects and 
underlying mechanism(s) in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model have 
not been adequately addressed. This study was aimed to investigate the 
beneficial effects of etazolate on CUMS-induced behavioral deficits (depression- 
and anxiety-like behaviors). In addition, the possible underlying mechanism(s) 
of etazolate in CUMS model was also investigated by measuring serum 
corticosterone (CORT) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. Mice 
were subjected to a battery of stressors for 28 days. Etazolate (0.5 and 1 
mg/kg, p.o.) and fluoxetine (20mg/kg, p.o.) were administered during the last 21 
days (8-28th) of the CUMS paradigm. The results showed that 4-weeks CUMS 
produces significant depression-like behavior in tail suspension test (TST) and 
partial anxiety-like behavior in elevated plus maze (EPM) and open field test 
(OFT). Stressed mice have also shown a significant high serum CORT and low BDNF 
level. Chronic treatment with etazolate (0.5 and 1mg/kg., p.o.) and fluoxetine 
(20mg/kg., p.o.) produced significant antidepressant-like behavior in TST 
(decreased duration of immobility), whereas, partial anxiolytic-like behavior in 
EPM (increased percentage of open arm entries) and OFT (increased % central 
ambulation score, total ambulation score and time spent in center zone). In 
addition, etazolate and fluoxetine treatment significantly (p<0.05) increased 
the BDNF level and inhibited the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) 
axis hyperactivity, as evidenced by low serum CORT level in stressed mice. In 
addition, etazolate and fluoxetine also showed significant antidepressant- and 
anxiolytic-like effects in normal control mice. In this study no significant 
changes were observed in locomotor activity in actophotometer test. Moreover, we 
did not find any effect of etazolate and fluoxetine on CORT and BDNF levels in 
normal control mice. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggested 
compelling evidences that etazolate has more marked effect on depression-like 
behavior in mice, which is atleast in part may be related to their modulating 
effects on the HPA axis and BDNF level.

Decreased interest in pleasurable stimuli including social withdrawal and 
reduced libido are some of the key symptomatic criteria for major depression, 
and thus assays that measure social and sexual behavior in rodents may be highly 
appropriate for modeling depressive states. Here we present a novel approach for 
validating rodent models of depression by assessing male urine scent marking 
(USM) made in consequence to a spot of urine from a proestrous female. USM is an 
ethologically important form of sexual communication expressed by males to 
attract females. The expression of this behavior is highly sensitive and 
adaptive to environmental cues and social status. We hypothesized that male USM 
behavior offers a naturalistic measure of social motivation that can be used to 
evaluate hedonic behaviors relevant to the study of mood disorders. We 
demonstrated that 1) adult male mice displayed a strong preference for marking 
proestrous female urine with a high degree of specificity, 2) exposure to 
chronic social defeat profoundly decreased USM whereas exposure to environmental 
enrichment increased USM, 3) the standard antidepressant fluoxetine reversed 
declines in USM induced by social defeat, 4) USM behavior closely correlated 
with other hedonic measures, and 5) USM scores in non-stressed mice predicted 
behavioral outcomes after defeat exposure such that mice displaying high 
preference for marking female urine prior to social defeat showed behavioral 
resiliency after social defeat. The findings indicate that the USM test is a 
sensitive, validated measure of psychosocial stress effects that has high 
predictive value for examination of stress resiliency and vulnerability and 
their neurobiological substrates.

Current evidences support inflammation, oxidative and nitrogen stress, as well 
as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling mechanisms as important in 
depression pathophysiology. Tetracycline antibiotics have anti-inflammatory and 
antioxidant properties. Preliminary evidence indicates that minocycline has 
antidepressant properties. Doxycycline (DOXY) has favorable pharmacokinetic and 
safety profiles when compared to other tetracycline congeners. The 
antidepressant activity of DOXY has not been adequately investigated. This study 
evaluated the effects of DOXY (25 and 50 mg/kg, i.p.) on LPS-induced (0.5 mg/kg, 
i.p.) depressive-like behavior. Doxycycline was administered 30 min before LPS 
(pre-LPS) or 1.5 and 23.5 h following LPS (post-LPS) administration in mice. 
LPS-treated animals presented an increase in immobility time in the forced 
swimming test (FST) when compared to controls 24 h after endotoxin 
administration. Similarly to imipramine (IMI-10 mg/kg, i.p.), DOXY at both doses 
prevented and reversed LPS-induced alterations in the FST. IL-1β content was 
increased 24 h after LPS administration in striatum, hippocampus and prefrontal 
cortex. IMI and DOXY prevented and reversed LPS-induced increase in IL-1β. IMI 
and DOXY also prevented and reversed LPS-induced alterations in nitrite content 
and oxidative stress parameters (lipid peroxidation and reduced glutathione 
levels). Both DOXY and IMI prevented LPS-induced decrease in hippocampal BDNF 
levels. Taken together, our results demonstrate that DOXY is comparable to IMI 
in effectively ameliorate LPS-induced depressive-like behavior, providing a 
rationale for testing DOXY's antidepressant efficacy in humans.

Taking into account that pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative and 
nitrosative stress are implicated in the pathogenesis of depression and that 
α-tocopherol has antidepressant, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, 
this study investigated the ability of α-tocopherol to abolish the 
depressive-like behavior induced by i.c.v. administration of TNF-α in the mouse 
TST. Additionally, we investigated the occurrence of changes in the levels of 
Bcl2 and Bax and phosphorylation of GSK-3β (Ser9) in the hippocampus of mice. 
The administration of TNF-α (0.001fg/site, i.c.v.) increased the immobility time 
in the TST, which was prevented by the administration of α-tocopherol at the 
doses of 10, 30 and 100mg/kg (p.o.). Subeffective doses of α-tocopherol 
(10mg/kg, p.o.) and/or the antidepressants fluoxetine (5mg/kg, p.o.), imipramine 
(0.1mg/kg, p.o.) and bupropion (1mg/kg, p.o.), the NMDA receptor antagonist 
MK-801 (0.001mg/kg, p.o.) or the neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitor 
7-nitroindazole (25mg/kg, i.p.) prevented the depressive-like effect induced by 
TNF-α. None of the treatments altered the locomotor activity of mice. Treatment 
with TNF-α and/or α-tocopherol did not alter the levels of Bax and Bcl2 or the 
phosphorylation of GSK-3β in the hippocampus of mice. Together, our results show 
a synergistic antidepressant-like effect of α-tocopherol with antidepressants 
against the depressive-like behavior induced by an inflammatory insult, 
suggesting that this vitamin may be useful to optimize conventional 
pharmacotherapy of depression, including depressive states associated with 
inflammatory conditions.

Melatonin ameliorates chronic mild stress induced behavioral dysfunctions in 
mice.

Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences, Delhi, India.

Melatonin, a neurohormone, is known to regulate several physiological functions, 
especially the circadian homeostasis, mood and behavior. Chronic exposure to 
stress is involved in the etiology of human affective disorders, and depressed 
patients have been reported to show changes in the circadian rhythms and 
nocturnal melatonin concentration. The present study was conducted to evaluate a 
possible beneficial action of chronic night-time melatonin treatment against 
chronic mild stress (CMS) induced behavioral impairments. As expected in the 
present study, the stress exposed mice showed reduced weight gain, hedonic 
deficit, cognitive deficits and decreased mobility in behavioral despair test. 
Interestingly, CMS exposed mice showed less anxiety. Chronic night-time 
melatonin administration significantly ameliorated the stress-induced behavioral 
disturbances, especially the cognitive dysfunction and depressive phenotypes. In 
conclusion, the present findings suggest the mitigating role of melatonin 
against CMS-induced behavioral changes, including the cognitive dysfunctions and 
reaffirm its potential role as an antidepressant.

OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of Shuyu Ningxin Recipe (SNR) on the 
praxiology and the expressions of hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor 
(BDNF) and its receptor tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) of model rats with chronic 
stress-induced depression, thus exploring its anti-depression mechanisms.
METHODS: Sixty adult SD rats were randomly divided into 6 groups, i.e., the 
normal control group, the model group, the fluoxetine group, the high dose SNR 
group, the medium dose SNR group, and the low dose SNR group, 10 in each group. 
All rats were subjected to establish chronic stress-induced depression model for 
21 consecutive days. Except those in the normal control group, rats in the rest 
groups received gastrogavage from the 22nd day. Mice in the model group were 
administered with normal saline by gastrogavage. SNR at 25.0, 7.5, and 2.5 g/kg 
was respectively administered to rats in the high dose SNR group, the medium 
dose SNR group, and the low dose SNR group by gastrogavage. Fluoxetine 
suspension (12 mg/kg) was given to rats in the fluoxetine group by 
gastro-gavage. All medication lasted for 3 successive weeks. The weight, 
open-field test, and the immobility time in forced swimming test were determined 
before modeling, 3 weeks (after successful modeling), and 6 weeks (by the end of 
medication). The expressions of hippocampal BDNF and TrkB were measured after 
the brain tissues were drawn by the end of the experiment.
RESULTS: Compared with the normal control group, the body weight grew slowly, 
the behavior index decreased, the immobility time in forced swimming test was 
prolonged, and the expressions of BDNF and TrkB were weaken in the model group 
(P <0.05, P <0.01).The body weight increased, the behavior was improved, the 
immobility time in forced swimming test was shortened, and the expressions of 
BDNF and TrkB were enhanced in the high dose SNR group and the fluoxetine group 
by the and of medication, showing statistical difference when compared with the 
model group (P <0.05, P <0.01).
CONCLUSION: SNR could exert anti-depression by improving the expression levels 
of hippocampal BDNF and TrkB.

Neonatal NMDA receptor blockade alters anxiety- and depression-related behaviors 
in a sex-dependent manner in mice.

There is increasing evidence that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blockade 
in the neonatal period has a long-lasting influence on brain and behavior 
development and has been linked to an increased risk for neuropsychiatric 
disorders in later life. We sought to determine whether postnatal NMDA receptor 
blockade can affect normal development of body weight, corticosterone levels, 
anxiety- and depression-related behaviors in male and female mice in adulthood. 
For this purpose, male and female NMRI mice were treated with either saline or 
phencyclidine (PCP; 5 and 10 mg/kg, s.c.) on postnatal days (PND) 7, 9, and 11, 
and then subjected to different behavioral tests, including open field, elevated 
plus-maze, elevated zero-maze, light-dark box, tail suspension test and forced 
swimming test in adulthood. The results indicated that neonatal PCP treatment 
reduced body weight during neonatal and adulthood periods, and did not alter 
baseline corticosterone levels in both male and female mice. Moreover, this 
study obtained some experimental evidence showing the PCP at dose of 10 mg/kg 
increases stress-induced corticosterone levels, anxiety- and depression-related 
behaviors in males, while decreasing levels of anxiety without any significant 
effect on depression in female mice in adulthood. These data support the 
argument that neonatal NMDA receptor blockade can lead to behavioral 
abnormalities and psychiatric diseases in adulthood. Collectively, our findings 
suggest that neonatal exposure to PCP may have profound effects on the 
development of anxiety- and depression-related behaviors in a sex- and 
dose-dependent manner in mice.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Eupatorium triplinerve Vahl belongs to the 
Asteraceae family, popularly known as Japana. It is a perennial shrub native to 
Amazon rainforests of South America. Its leaves are used through infusions, 
decoctions, baths, and tea. It is largely used in Brazilian folk medicine as 
sedative, febrifuge, stimulant, tonic and anti-inflammatory.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study evaluated the putative effects of Eupatorium 
triplinerve on the central nervous system (CNS), including locomotor and anxiety 
activity, depression-like behavior, and antinociception and oxidative stress.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two-month-old male Wistar rats (n=7-10 rats/group) and 
Swiss male and female mice of the species Mus musculus (n=7-10 per group) were 
administered with 100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg, 400 mg/kg, 600 mg/kg, and 800 mg/kg of 
hydroalcoholic extracts of Eupatorium triplinerve (HEET). The behavioral assays 
included open-field (OF), elevated Plus-maze (EPM), and forced swimming tests 
(FS). The antinociceptive activity was verified using chemical (acetic acid and 
formalin) and thermal (hot plate) models of nociception. The oxidative stress 
levels were measured in rat blood samples after behavioral assays and Trolox 
equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), nitric oxide and malondialdehyde (MDA) 
levels were measured in vivo.
RESULTS: Oral pretreatment with HEET reduced the locomotion in OF test (200-800 
mg/kg), increased central locomotion and open arms entries in the OF and EPM 
tests, respectively (600-800 mg/kg), and decreased the immobility time in the FS 
(200-800 mg/kg). It also reduced the writhing number evoked by acetic acid 
injection (200-800 mg/kg) and licking time in the first phase of the formalin 
test (400-800 mg/kg). In the oxidative stress assays, the extract decreased 
TEAC, Nitric Oxide and MDA levels in response to swimming stress induced in 
rats.
CONCLUSIONS: These results were indicative for the first time that Eupatorium 
triplinerve exerted mild sedative, anxiolytic and antidepressive effects on the 
CNS. Antinociceptive effects not related to opioid system and antioxidant 
activity were also observed. These results support the ethnopharmacological use 
of Eupatorium triplinerve in popular medicine.

Depression is associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, although 
the molecular mechanism behind the pathological link remains unclear. Orexin, a 
hypothalamic neuropeptide regulating energy and glucose homeostasis, has been 
implicated in the endogenous antidepressant mechanism. To clarify whether orexin 
is involved in the coordination between mental and metabolic functions, we 
investigated the influence of orexin deficiency on social interaction behavior 
and glucose metabolism in mice subjected to chronic social defeat stress. 
Chronic stress-induced glucose intolerance and systemic insulin resistance as 
well as social avoidance were ameliorated by calorie restriction in an 
orexin-dependent manner. Moreover, orexin-deficient mice maintained under ad 
libitum-fed conditions after defeat stress exhibited hyperinsulinemia and 
elevated HOMA-IR (homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance), despite 
normal fasting blood glucose levels. In a pyruvate tolerance test to evaluate 
hepatic insulin sensitivity, chronic stress-induced abnormal glucose elevation 
was observed in orexin-deficient but not wild-type mice, although both types of 
mice were susceptible to chronic stress. In addition, insulin-induced 
phosphorylation of Akt in the liver was impaired in orexin-deficient but not 
wild-type mice after chronic stress. These results demonstrate that the central 
physiological actions of orexin under ad libitum-fed conditions are required for 
the adaptive response to chronic defeat stress, which can prevent the 
development of hepatic insulin resistance but not social avoidance behavior. 
Moreover, calorie restriction, a paradigm to strongly activate orexin neurons, 
appears to prevent the persistence of depression-like behavior per se, leading 
to the amelioration of impaired glucose metabolism after chronic stress; 
therefore, we suggest that hypothalamic orexin system is the key for inhibiting 
the exacerbating link between depression and type 2 diabetes.

β-endorphin modulates the effect of stress on novelty-suppressed feeding.

Although stress is implicated in the pathophysiology of mood and anxiety 
disorders, not all individuals who suffer stressful life events develop 
psychopathology. Differential susceptibility to stress may be influenced by 
genetically mediated differences in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis 
activity and moderation of the stress response by the opioid peptide β-endorphin 
(β-E). The present study investigated genetic contributions to coping behavior 
by examining anxious behavior of transgenic mice with varying capacities to 
synthesize β-E [B6.129S2-Pomc (tm1Low) /J; regulated by insertion of a premature 
stop codon into one or both copies of the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene], both 
under normal conditions and following 3 min of forced swim (FS). Ten minutes 
after this stress exposure or a control manipulation, acutely food-deprived 
female and male transgenic mice were subjected to a novelty-suppressed feeding 
(NSF) test, during which their interaction with an almond slice located in the 
center of an open field box was measured. There was an interaction between 
genotype and stress for latency to approach the almond and whether or not the 
almond was approached, such that mice with low or absent β-E displayed a 
stronger aversion to novelty-feeding after stress exposure than did mice with 
normal levels. These data provide evidence for a moderating effect of β-E on the 
behavioral response to stress. Genotypic differences in anxious behavior emerged 
when mice were stressed prior to behavioral assessment, suggesting that β-E 
plays a role in coping behavior. These findings indicate that genetic 
variability in sensitivity of the β-E system to stress may contribute, at least 
in part, to heritable differences in stress reactivity as well as vulnerability 
to stress-related psychopathology.

Cholinergic signaling in the hippocampus regulates social stress resilience and 
anxiety- and depression-like behavior.

Symptoms of depression can be induced in humans through blockade of 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) whereas antidepressant-like effects can be produced 
in animal models and some clinical trials by limiting activity of acetylcholine 
(ACh) receptors. Thus, ACh signaling could contribute to the etiology of mood 
regulation. To test this hypothesis, we administered the AChE inhibitor 
physostigmine to mice and demonstrated an increase in anxiety- and 
depression-like behaviors that was reversed by administration of nicotinic or 
muscarinic antagonists. The behavioral effects of physostigmine were also 
reversed by administration of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor 
fluoxetine. Administration of fluoxetine also increased AChE activity throughout 
the brain, with the greatest change in the hippocampus. To determine whether 
cholinergic signaling in the hippocampus could contribute to the systemic 
effects of cholinergic drugs, we infused physostigmine or virally delivered 
shRNAs targeting AChE into the hippocampus. Both pharmacological and molecular 
genetic decreases in hippocampal AChE activity increased anxiety- and 
depression-like behaviors and decreased resilience to repeated stress in a 
social defeat paradigm. The behavioral changes due to shRNA-mediated knockdown 
of AChE were rescued by coinfusion of an shRNA-resistant AChE transgene into the 
hippocampus and reversed by systemic administration of fluoxetine. These data 
demonstrate that ACh signaling in the hippocampus promotes behaviors related to 
anxiety and depression. The sensitivity of these effects to fluoxetine suggests 
that shRNA-mediated knockdown of hippocampal AChE represents a model for 
anxiety- and depression-like phenotypes. Furthermore, abnormalities in the 
cholinergic system may be critical for the etiology of mood disorders and could 
represent an endophenotype of depression.

The orexin/hypocretin peptide signaling system plays a neuromodulatory role in 
motivation and stress; two critical components of depression. Although work has 
been done to identify links between orexin and depression, few specific 
neuroanatomical associations have been made. These studies have not investigated 
the relationship between orexin and orexin receptor expression in specific brain 
regions associated with this disorder. To address this, we examined immobility 
during the forced swim test (FST) in mice, a commonly used measure of depressive 
behavior. We analyzed the variation in FST immobility with the distribution of 
orexin and its receptor mRNA. We found that animals that exhibited more robust 
depressive behavior had greater or lesser orexin system expression that depended 
on the limbic brain region analyzed. In the hippocampus there was a negative 
correlation between orexin expression and FST immobility. Animals that displayed 
relatively more depressive behavior had lower hippocampal expression of Orexin A 
(OrxA). In the amygdala, there was a curvilinear relationship between OrxA and 
FST performance. In addition there was a positive correlation with amygdalar 
Type I orexin receptor (Orx1) mRNA and depressive behavior. Despite the 
differences in limbic orexin expression, there was no correlation between 
immobility and hypothalamic orexin neuron activation as measured by c-Fos. 
Overall, more severe depressive behavior was associated with reduced hippocampal 
orexin expression, contrasted with increased orexin plus Orx1 receptor mRNA 
expression in the amygdala. This divergent pattern between the hippocampus and 
amygdala mirrors a neurobiological theme seen in depression resulting from 
reduced hippocampal, but increased amygdalar, size and function.

alterations.

Chronic restraint stress can induce depressive and anxiety-like behavior and 
neurophysiological disturbances. The social living shows the health-promoting 
and stress-protective effects on both human and animal. However, whether group 
housing exerts effects on development of depression and anxiety induced by 
chronic restraint treatments and its detailed neuroendocrine mechanism remain 
unclear. Following repeated restraint, the anxiety and depression-like behaviors 
of single and group housing mice were examined using the elevated plus-maze, 
open field test and forced swimming test. The levels of central oxytocin (OT) 
expression in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), glucocorticoid receptors (GR) 
in the hippocampus and serum OT and corticosterone (CORT) were also measured 
using immunohistochemistry and ELISA methods. Our results show that chronic 
restraint significantly decreased time in open arm of elevated plus maze and 
increased immobility time in forced swimming test in single-housed mice. 
However, chronic restraint exerted no effects on these aspects in group-housed 
mice. Accompanying the changes of behaviors, chronic restraint up-regulated 
levels of serum CORT and reduced the hippocampus GR in single-housed animals, 
but did not change these measures in group-housed mice. Furthermore, repeated 
restraint had no effect on OT levels in these two housing conditions although 
group-housing significantly increased the PVN OT levels. Taken together, these 
results provide substantial evidence that group housing can reduce levels of 
anxiety and depression induced by chronic restraint stress in mice. The 
elevation of central GR and OT, and decrease of circulating CORT may possibly be 
involved in these buffering effects.

Behavioral analysis of relaxin-3 deficient mice.

Tanaka M, Furube E, Aoki M, Watanabe Y.

Relaxin-3 is a neuropeptide belonging to the relaxin/insulin superfamily. 
Studies using rodents have revealed that relaxin-3 is predominantly expressed in 
neurons in the nucleus incertus of the pons, projecting axons to forebrain 
regions including the hypothalamus. There is evidence that relaxin-3 is involved 
in several functions, including food intake and stress responses. We generated 
relaxin-3 gene knockout (KO) mice and examined them using a battery of 
behavioral tests of sensory/motor functions and emotion-related behaviors. 
Relaxin-3 KO mice exhibited normal growth and appearance. There was no 
difference in bodyweight among genotypes in both normal and high fat diet 
feeding. In addition, there were no significant differences between wild-type 
and KO mice in social interaction, depression-like behavior, and short memory 
test. However, in the elevated plus maze test, KO mice exhibited a robust 
increase in the tendency to enter open arms, although they exhibited normal 
performance in a light/dark transition test and showed no difference from 
wild-type mice in the open field test. Taken together, these results indicate 
that relaxin-3 KO mice exhibit mild anxiolytic characteristics relative to 
wild-type mice, suggesting that this peptide is involved in anxiety-related 
behavior.

RNA splicing and editing modulation of 5-HT(2C) receptor function: relevance to 
anxiety and aggression in VGV mice.

Changes in serotonin(2C) receptor (5-HTR2c) editing, splicing and density were 
found in conditions such as depression and suicide, but mechanisms explaining 
the changes in 5-HTR2c function are unknown. Thus, mice expressing only the 
fully edited VGV isoform of 5-HTR2c, in which clinically relevant behavioral 
changes are associated with alterations in splicing and receptor density, were 
studied. VGV mice displayed enhanced anxiety-like behavior in response to a 
preferential 5-HTR2c agonist in the social interaction test. Nearly half of 
interactions between pairs of VGV congeners consisted of fighting behaviors, 
whereas no fighting occurred in wild-type (WT) mice. VGV mice also exhibited a 
striking increase in freezing behaviors in reaction to an innately aversive 
ultrasonic stimulus. This behavioral phenotype occurred in conjunction with 
decreased brain 5-HT turnover during stress. These functional data were put in 
relation with the 5-HTR2c mRNA splicing process generating a truncated protein 
(5-HTR2c-Tr) in addition to the full-length receptor (5-HTR2c-Fl). 5-HTR2c-Tr 
mRNA was less abundant in many brain regions of VGV mice, which concomitantly 
had more 5-HTR2c than WT mice. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer and 
bioluminescence resonance energy transfer studies in transfected living HEK293T 
cells showed that 5-HTR2c-Tr interacts with 5-HTR2c-Fl. The 5-HTR2c-Tr was 
localized in the endoplasmic reticulum where it retained 5-HTR2c-Fl, preventing 
the latter to reach the plasma membrane. Consequently, 5-HTR2c-Tr decreased 
(3)H-mesulergine binding to 5-HTR2c-Fl at the plasma membrane in a 
concentration-dependent manner and more strongly with edited 5-HTR2c-Fl. These 
results suggest that 5-HTR2c pre-mRNA editing and splicing are entwined 
processes determining increased 5-HTR2c levels in pathological conditions 
through a deficit in 5-HTR2c-Tr.

Approximately 30 years ago, we developed 2 mouse lines with enhanced and 
decreased opioid system activity using bidirectional selection for high (high 
analgesia [HA] line) and low (low analgesia [LA] line) swim stress-induced 
analgesia. These mouse lines differ substantially in pain sensitivity, measured 
as hind paw withdrawal latency in a hot plate test. Moreover, compared with the 
LA mice, the HA mice exhibited reduced energy expenditure under stress and 
different depression-like behavior as well as higher sensitivity to mutagens and 
the high frequency of spontaneous and carcinogen-induced tumors. In the current 
study, we observed distinct differences in the growth rate of orthotopically 
implanted melanoma and the onset of cancer pain. Whereas the HA line was prone 
to tumors and carcinogenesis was rapid in all specimens, the LA mice either did 
not develop tumors (70%) or developed tumors that often regressed spontaneously 
(30%). Animals from both lines developed robust thermal hypersensitivity in the 
tumor-bearing paw compared with animals that were injected with saline. However, 
we found that hyperalgesia in tumor-bearing mice persists for a much shorter 
time in the HA than in LA mice. Naltrexone, given subcutaneously, restored 
hyperalgesia in the HA mice, whereas it was ineffective in the LA mice. The 
results suggest that activity of the opioid system may influence carcinogenesis 
and the intensity of cancer pain and indicates that HA and LA mice are good 
models for such studies.

BACKGROUND: Recent data suggest that major depression is potentially associated 
with dysregulated cytokine production. However, the roles of T helper (Th) cells 
and their subsets in the development of depression still remain to be 
determined. The present study assessed changes in Th cell subsets and cytokines 
during the development of depression in a mouse model.
METHODS: Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) was used to simulate 
depression behavior in mice. The open field test, sucrose preference, and 
ingestion were used as evaluative indicators of depressive behavior. During the 
CUMS protocol, on days 3, 7, 14, and 21, we assessed behavioral changes, 
cytokine levels in serum or stimulated (CD3/CD28) cell culture medium, and mRNA 
expression (ELISA, RT-PCR), regulatory T (Treg) and Th17 subsets in spleen (ex 
vivo, flow cytometry, RT-PCR), and CD3/rIL-23-stimulated Th17 cell proliferation 
(MTT assay).
RESULTS: The results showed that in the depression model mice, IL-4 mRNA 
expression and serum levels increased on day 7, while no detectable change was 
observed in IFN-γ. Notably, a reduced proportion of Th17 cells with decreased 
proliferation capacity was observed at later stages, in parallel with a decline 
in serum IL-23 levels. In contrast, an increased Treg cell proportion and 
increased Foxp3 mRNA expression were observed in the mid-stages. Correlation 
analysis showed that the proportion of Tregs was correlated negatively with 
sucrose preference, while the proliferation of Th17 cells was notably correlated 
positively with sucrose preference. Also, an increased TGF-β level was detected 
in serum and was believed to be a key factor responsible for the imbalance 
between Th17 and Treg cells. Furthermore, the sucrose preference in TGF-β type I 
receptor blockade mice increased considerably, compared with CUMS mice.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that in CUMS-induced depression, behavioral 
changes may closely correlate with the imbalance between Th17 and Treg cell 
subsets, and TGF-β may be a key regulatory cytokine.

Experimental and epidemiological studies have shown the close relationship 
between stressful events, depression, and cognitive impairment. Folic acid has 
been reported to present antidepressant-like effects in both experimental and 
clinical approaches. However, the mechanisms mediating such effects are not 
understood. In the present study, we evaluated if folic acid administration to 
mice could protect against restraint stress-induced depressive-like behavior and 
cognitive deficit. Considering that oxidative stress has been pointed as a key 
event involved with depressive disorders, cerebrocortical and hippocampal 
oxidative stress-related parameters, such as the activities of antioxidant 
enzymes (mainly those related to the hydroperoxide-detoxifying system) and 
markers of lipid peroxidation, were also investigated. Restraint stress induced 
depressive-like behavior in the forced swimming test and memory impairment in 
the object recognition test, without altering locomotor activity of mice. Folic 
acid (50 mg/kg, p.o.) was able to prevent the stress-induced increase on 
immobility time in the forced swimming test, but did not prevent memory 
impairment. Moreover, restraint stress increased thiobarbituric acid reactive 
substance levels, and catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase 
activities in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and superoxide dismutase 
activity in the hippocampus. Folic acid treatment restored the activity of the 
antioxidant enzymes and reduced lipid peroxidation in the hippocampus. 
Glutathione, a non-enzymatic antioxidant, was not altered by stress and/or folic 
acid administration. Together, the results of the present work reinforce the 
notion that folic acid displays a specific antidepressant profile in the 
restraint stress paradigm that may be at least partly due to its antioxidant 
role.

BACKGROUND: Early life trauma is an important risk factor for many psychiatric 
and somatic disorders in adulthood. As a growing body of evidence suggests that 
brain plasticity is disturbed in affective disorders, we examined the short-term 
and remote effects of early life stress on different forms of brain plasticity.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Mice were subjected to early deprivation by 
individually separating pups from their dam in the first two weeks after birth. 
Distinct forms of brain plasticity were assessed in the hippocampus by 
longitudinal MR volumetry, immunohistochemistry of neurogenesis, and whole-cell 
patch-clamp measurements of synaptic plasticity. Depression-related behavior was 
assessed by the forced swimming test in adult animals. Neuropeptides and their 
receptors were determined by real-time PCR and immunoassay. Early maternal 
deprivation caused a loss of hippocampal volume, which returned to normal in 
adulthood. Adult neurogenesis was unaffected by early life stress. Long-term 
synaptic potentiation, however, was normal immediately after the end of the 
stress protocol but was impaired in adult animals. In the forced swimming test, 
adult animals that had been subjected to early life stress showed increased 
immobility time. Levels of substance P were increased both in young and adult 
animals after early deprivation.
CONCLUSION: Hippocampal volume was affected by early life stress but recovered 
in adulthood which corresponded to normal adult neurogenesis. Synaptic 
plasticity, however, exhibited a delayed impairment. The modulation of synaptic 
plasticity by early life stress might contribute to affective dysfunction in 
adulthood.

AIMS: Tianeptine is an atypical antidepressant drug that has a different 
mechanism of action than other antidepressants. Olanzapine is an atypical 
antipsychotic drug used for the treatment of schizophrenia. The present study 
was undertaken to investigate effects of chronic administration of tianeptine or 
olanzapine on unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS)-induced depression-like 
behavior in mice compared to a widely used SSRI antidepressant, fluoxetine.
MAIN METHODS: Male inbred BALB/c mice were subjected to different kinds of 
stressors several times a day for 7weeks and were treated intraperitoneally with 
tianeptine (5mg/kg), olanzapine (2.5mg/kg), fluoxetine (15mg/kg) or vehicle for 
5weeks (n=7-8 per group).
KEY FINDINGS: All the drugs tested prevented stress-induced deficit in coat 
state during UCMS procedure, in grooming behavior in the splash test, decreased 
the attack frequency in the resident intruder test and decreased the immobility 
time in the tail suspension test. In the open field test olanzapine had 
anxiolytic-like effects in both stressed and non-stressed mice. Tianeptine, 
olanzapine and fluoxetine decreased the enhanced levels of plasma ACTH and IL-6. 
Chronic treatment with tianeptine resulted in a significant increase in both 
total number and density of BrdU-labeled cells in stressed animals, while 
fluoxetine and olanzapine had a partial effect.
SIGNIFICANCE: The results of this study support the hypothesis that tianeptine 
can be as effective as fluoxetine for the treatment of depression in spite of 
the differences in the mechanism of action of these drugs. Moreover, olanzapine 
could be used effectively in psychotic patients with depression.

Phosphorylation of MeCP2 at Ser421 contributes to chronic antidepressant action.

(1)Department of Neurobiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North 
Carolina 27710, USA.

Although tricyclic antidepressants rapidly activate monoaminergic 
neurotransmission, these drugs must be administered chronically to alleviate 
symptoms of depression. This observation suggests that molecular mechanisms 
downstream of monoamine receptor activation, which include the induction of gene 
transcription, underlie chronic antidepressant-induced changes in behavior. Here 
we show that methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) regulates behavioral responses 
to chronic antidepressant treatment. Imipramine administration induces 
phosphorylation of MeCP2 at Ser421 (pMeCP2) selectively in the nucleus accumbens 
and the lateral habenula, two brain regions important for depressive-like 
behaviors. To test the role of pMeCP2 in depressive-like behaviors, we used male 
mice that bear a germ-line mutation knocked into the X-linked Mecp2 locus that 
changes Ser421 to a nonphosphorylatable Ala residue (S421A). MeCP2 S421A 
knock-in (KI) mice showed increased immobility in forced-swim and 
tail-suspension tests compared with their wild-type (WT) littermates. However, 
immobility of both MeCP2 WT and KI mice in forced swim was reduced by acute 
administration of imipramine, demonstrating that loss of pMeCP2 does not impair 
acute pharmacological sensitivity to this drug. After chronic social defeat 
stress, chronic administration of imipramine significantly improved social 
interaction in the MeCP2 WT mice. In contrast, the MeCP2 KI mice did not respond 
to chronic imipramine administration. These data suggest novel roles for pMeCP2 
in the sensitivity to stressful stimuli and demonstrate that pMeCP2 is required 
for the effects of chronic imipramine on depressive-like behaviors induced by 
chronic social defeat stress.

Studies have demonstrated an association between stressful conditions and the 
onset of clinical depression. Considering the antidepressant-like properties of 
ascorbic acid in both experimental and clinical approaches, we evaluated the 
beneficial effect of this vitamin on restraint stress-induced behavioral and 
neurochemical alterations. Acute restraint stress caused a depressive-like 
behavior in the forced swimming test, accompanied by increased lipid 
peroxidation (cerebral cortex and hippocampus); increased superoxide dismutase 
(cerebral cortex and hippocampus), glutathione reductase (cerebral cortex), and 
glutathione peroxidase (cerebral cortex and hippocampus) activities; and 
elevated expression of Bcl-2 (hippocampus). Oral administration of ascorbic acid 
(1 mg/kg) or fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) 1 h before restraint stress prevented the 
stress-induced increase on immobility time in the forced swimming test. 
Moreover, this vitamin reduced lipid peroxidation to control levels and restored 
the activity of superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione 
peroxidase. Ascorbic acid had no effect on the increased level of Bcl-2 induced 
by stress. Glutathione levels, glycogen synthase kinase-3β phosphorylation, and 
Bax expression were not altered by stress or ascorbic acid administration. 
Besides reinforcing the antioxidant potential of ascorbic acid, our results 
support the notion that oxidative stress plays a role in the pathogenesis and 
treatment of stress-induced depression.

High level of serum corticosteroid is frequently associated with depression, in 
which a notable HPA (hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal) axis hyperactivity is often 
observed. There are two types of corticosteroid receptors expressed in the 
hippocampus that provide potent negative feedback regulation on the HPA axis but 
dysfunction during depression, i.e. the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and the 
mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). The balance between hippocampal MR and GR 
during chronic stress plays an important role in the occurrence of depression. 
The aim of this study is to explore if chronic corticosterone administration 
would induce depression-like behavior and affect the expression and function of 
hippocampal MR and GR, in addition to assess whether manipulation of 
corticosteroid receptors would modulate depressive behaviors. Hence, mice were 
treated with corticosterone (40 mg/kg) for 21 days followed by assessment in a 
battery of depression-like behaviors. The results show that chronic 
corticosterone-treated animals displayed an increased immobility time in a 
forced-swimming test, decreased preference to sucrose solution and novel object 
recognition performance, and enhanced hippocampal serotonin but decreased MR 
expression in both hippocampus and hypothalamus. On the other hand, 
co-administration of MR antagonist, spironolactone (25mg/kg, i.p. × 7 days) in 
corticosteroid-treated animals reduced immobility time in a forced-swimming test 
and improved performance in a novel object recognition test. In conclusion, we 
demonstrate that chronic corticosterone treatment triggers several 
depression-like behaviors, and in parallel, down-regulates MR expression in the 
hippocampus and hypothalamus. Administration of an MR antagonist confers an 
anti-depressant effect in chronic corticosterone-treated animals.

estradiol treatment in inbred and outbred adult female mice.

Puberty is a period characterized by brain reorganization that contributes to 
the development of neural and behavioral responses to gonadal steroids. A single 
injection of the bacterial endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), during the 
pubertal period decreases sexual receptivity in response to ovarian hormones in 
adulthood. Because chronic estradiol treatment alleviates depression-like 
symptoms in ovariectomized adult mice, we investigated the effect of pubertal 
LPS treatment on estradiol's antidepressant effects. We hypothesized that 
pubertal LPS treatment would decrease the antidepressant-like effect of 
estradiol in adult ovariectomized female mice, as it decreases other behavioral 
responses to ovarian hormones. As expected, chronic estradiol treatment 
decreased depression-like behavior, as measured by the duration of immobility, 
in saline-treated mice from two different strains, as well as in mice treated 
with LPS in adulthood. In contrast, in mice treated pubertally with LPS, 
estradiol strikingly increased the duration of immobility. No difference in body 
weight and in locomotion was found among the groups, suggesting that the 
differences in depression-like behavior were not due to differences in body 
weight or locomotor activity between LPS-treated and control mice. These results 
suggest that exposure to an immune challenge during the pubertal period alters 
the responsiveness of depression-like behavior to estradiol.

Chronic treatment with baicalin prevents the chronic mild stress-induced 
depressive-like behavior: involving the inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 in rat 
brain.

Baicalin, a major constituent of flavonoids isolated from Scutellariae Radix, 
has been previously confirmed to decrease the duration of immobility in mice 
exposed to the forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST). 
However, its antidepressant effects and mechanisms are still seldom studied in 
chronic mild stress (CMS) model of depression. In the present study, we 
attempted to investigate the effects of baicalin on the depressive-like 
behavior, the mRNA expression and activity of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), as well 
as prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) levels in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. 
Moreover, the serum corticosterone levels were also examined. We found that CMS 
procedure not only decreased the sucrose preference and increased serum 
corticosterone levels, but also elevated the activity and mRNA expression of 
COX-2, and increased PGE(2) levels in rat brain regions. Treatment with baicalin 
(10, 20, 40 mg/kg) prevented these abnormalities induced by CMS. These results 
confirmed that baicalin exerted antidepressant-like effects, and suggested its 
mechanisms at least partially related to decease COX-2 activity and expression, 
subsequently resulted in reduction of PGE(2) levels in brain. Our findings may 
provide a new aspect to understand the antidepressant action of baicalin, which 
is targeted on the COX-2 system in brain.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The present study investigated whether Chinese 
herbal medicines (CHMs) could reverse the effects of chronic mild stress (CMS) 
in a depression-like mouse model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effects of three Chinese herbals, Rhizome Chuanxiong, 
Radix Scutellaria and Radix Phellodendri on promoting neuroproliferation were 
evaluated in vitro first and followed by in vivo study of mice which were 
received by an experimental setting of CMS for 14 days. The effects of the three 
CHMs on depression were evaluated using a behavioral test, named a forced 
swimming test (FST). The possible anti-depressive mechanisms of these three 
CHMs, including the modulation of HPA axis and promoting the hippocampal 
precursor cell proliferation, were evaluated by measuring plasma corticosterone 
levels and BrdU incorporation.
RESULTS: The in vitro results of MTS assay showed that Rhizome Chuanxiong, Radix 
Scutellaria and Radix Phellodendri could promote the proliferation of neural 
stem cells (NSCs) in a concentration-dependent manner. The oral administration 
of these three CHMs for 14 days reversed not only the elevation of plasma 
corticosterone levels and body weight loss, but also the decreasing of 
hippocampal precursor cell proliferation and abnormal behavior in the CMS 
induced depression-like mouse model.
CONCLUSION: These results indicated that Rhizome Chuanxiong, Radix Scutellaria 
and Radix Phellodendri have the potential to ameliorate depression. The possible 
mechanisms were the inhibition of HPA axis hyperactivity and the increasing of 
hippocampal precursor cell proliferation. These findings supported the 
multicomponent and multitargeted approach of Chinese herbal medicine.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Hemerocallis citrina, a traditional herbal 
medicine, has been used for the improvement of behavioral and emotional status 
in Eastern-Asia countries.
AIM OF THE STUDY: Our previous studies have demonstrated that the ethanol 
extracts of H. citrina flowers (HCE) reversed the behavioral alterations and 
monoamine neurotransmitter dysfunctions in stressed mice. However, the relation 
of its antidepressant-like action with neurotrophic molecular expressions 
remains unknown.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: To clarify this, we explored the effect of HCE (32.5, 65, 
130mg/kg, p.o.) on the behavior, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and 
its receptor (TrkB) in depression-like rats induced by exogenous administration 
of the stress hormone corticosterone (40mg/kg, s.c.).
RESULTS: It was observed that repeated administration of corticosterone induced 
an elevation on the serum corticosterone levels, which caused the abnormalities 
observed in the sucrose preference test and forced swimming test (FST). 
Administration of HCE (65 and 130mg/kg) reversed the changes above and 
up-regulated the BDNF and TrkB receptor protein expressions in the brain region 
of frontal cortex and hippocampus.
CONCLUSION: These findings confirm that HCE produce an antidepressant-like 
effect in corticosterone-induced depression-like model of rats and this effect 
is at least partly mediated by BDNF-TrkB signaling in the frontal cortex and 
hippocampus.

Cancer patients often suffer long-lasting affective and cognitive impairments as 
a result of chemotherapy treatment. Previous work in our lab has shown deficits 
in learning and memory and hippocampal cell proliferation in mice lasting up to 
20 weeks following acute administration of thioTEPA. In this study, the effects 
of thioTEPA in conjunction with effects of chronic stress on depression-related 
behavior were examined in C57BL/6J mice, 12 weeks following thioTEPA 
administration. Chemotherapy-treated mice showed a diminished sucralose 
preference compared to controls that was further exacerbated after 2 weeks of 
daily restraint stress. This intensifying effect was not observed in the Porsolt 
forced swim test. Moreover, stress-induced corticosteroid responses were 
exaggerated in thioTEPA-treated mice. Cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus of 
the hippocampus was also impaired similarly by prior thioTEPA treatment and by 
daily restraint stress, with no additive effect. Results suggest that some 
depression-related impairments may be exacerbated by chemotherapy treatment 
through altered corticosteroid regulation.

behaviors in mice.

Stress has been shown to suppress immune function and increase susceptibility to 
inflammatory disease and psychiatric disease. CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T (Treg) 
cells are prominent in immune regulation. This study was conducted to determine 
if anti-CD25 antibody (Ab) mediated depletion of Treg cells in mice 
susceptibility to stress-induced development of depression-like behaviors, as 
well as immunological and neurochemical activity. To accomplish this, an 
elevated plus-maze test (EPM), tail suspension test (TST), and forced swim test 
(FST) were used to examine depression-like behaviors upon chronic immobilization 
stress. Immune imbalance status was observed based on analysis of serum 
cytokines using a mouse cytometric bead array in conjunction with flow cytometry 
and changes in the levels of serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) in the brain 
were measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The time spent 
in the open arms of the EPM decreased significantly and the immobility time in 
the FST increased significantly in the anti-CD25 Ab-treated group when compared 
with the non stressed wild-type group. In addition, interlukin-6 (IL-6), tumor 
necrosis factor-á (TNF-á), interlukin-2 (IL-2), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), 
interlukin-4 (IL-4) and interlukin-17A (IL-17A) concentrations were 
significantly upregulated in the stressed anti-CD25 Ab-treated group when 
compared with the non stressed wild-type group. Furthermore, the non stressed 
anti-CD25 Ab-treated group displayed decreased 5-HT levels within the 
hippocampus when compared with the non stressed wild-type group. These results 
suggest that CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg cell depletion modulated alterations in 
depressive behavior, cytokine and monoaminergic activity. Therefore, controlling 
CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg cell function during stress may be a potent therapeutic 
strategy for the treatment of depression-like symptoms.

Inhibitor of κB kinase (IκK) has historically been studied in the context of 
immune response and inflammation, but recent evidence demonstrates that IκK 
activity is necessary and sufficient for regulation of neuronal function. 
Chronic social defeat stress of mice increases IκK activity in the nucleus 
accumbens (NAc) and this increase is strongly correlated to depression-like 
behaviors. Inhibition of IκK signaling results in a reversal of chronic social 
defeat stress-induced social avoidance behavior. Here, we more completely define 
the role of IκK in anxiety and depressive-like behaviors. Mice underwent 
stereotaxic microinjection of a herpes simplex virus expressing either green 
fluorescent protein, a constitutively active form of IκK (IκKca), or a dominant 
negative form of IκK into the NAc. Of all three experimental groups, only mice 
expressing IκKca show a behavioral phenotype. Expression of IκKca results in a 
decrease in the time spent in the non-periphery zones of an open field arena and 
increased time spent immobile during a forced swim test. No baseline differences 
in sucrose preference were observed, but following the acute swim stress we 
noted a marked reduction in sucrose preference. To determine whether IκK 
activity alters responses to other acute stressors, we examined behavior and 
spine morphology in mice undergoing an acute social defeat stress. We found that 
IκKca enhanced social avoidance behavior and promoted thin spine formation. 
These data show that IκK in NAc is a critical regulator of both depressive- and 
anxiety-like states and may do so by promoting the formation of immature 
excitatory synapses.

An extremely low-frequency magnetic field (ELF-MF) is generated by power lines 
and household electrical devices. Many studies have suggested an association 
between chronic ELF-MF exposure and anxiety and/or depression. The mechanism of 
these effects is assumed to be a stress response induced by ELF-MF exposure. 
However, this mechanism remains controversial. In the present study, we 
investigated whether chronic ELF-MF exposure (intensity, 1.5 mT; [corrected] 
total exposure, 200 h) affected emotional behavior and corticosterone synthesis 
in mice. ELF-MF-treated mice showed a significant increase in total immobility 
time in a forced swim test and showed latency to enter the light box in a 
light-dark transition test, compared with sham-treated (control) mice. 
Corticosterone secretion was significantly high in the ELF-MF-exposed mice; 
however, no changes were observed in the amount of the adrenocorticotropic 
hormone and the expression of genes related to stress response. Quantification 
of the mRNA levels of adrenal corticosteroid synthesis enzymes revealed a 
significant reduction in Cyp17a1 mRNA in the ELF-MF-exposed mice. Our findings 
suggest the possibility that high intensity and chronic exposure to ELF-MF 
induces an increase in corticosterone secretion, along with depression- and/or 
anxiety-like behavior, without enhancement of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal 
axis.

Growing evidence indicates that an increase of orexin (or hypocretin) signaling 
is involved in the pathophysiology of major depression, but little is known 
regarding the causal link between the orexinergic system and depressive-like 
states. Here we blocked orexin receptors in mice subjected to unpredictable 
chronic mild stress (UCMS) to investigate putative antidepressant-like effects 
of this treatment, as well as the underlying mechanisms. BALB/c mice were 
exposed to 9 weeks of UCMS and from the third week onward treated daily with 
fluoxetine (20 mg/kg per day, per os) or with the dual orexin receptor 
antagonist almorexant (100 mg/kg per day, per os). The effects of UCMS regimen 
and pharmacological treatments were assessed by physical measures and behavioral 
testing. The dexamethasone suppression test was performed to examine the 
integrity of the negative feedback of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) 
axis, and immunohistochemical markers were used to assess cell proliferation 
(Ki-67), immature newborn neurons (doublecortin), and mature newborn neurons 
(5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine/NeuN) in the dorsal and ventral parts of the 
hippocampus. Our results show that 7 weeks of fluoxetine or almorexant 
treatments counteract the UCMS-induced physical and behavioral alterations. Both 
treatments prevented the HPA axis dysregulation caused by UCMS, but only 
fluoxetine reversed the UCMS-induced decrease of hippocampal cell proliferation 
and neurogenesis, while chronic almorexant treatment decreased cell 
proliferation and neurogenesis specifically in the ventral hippocampus. Taken 
together, this is the first evidence that pharmacological blockade of the 
orexinergic system induces a robust antidepressant-like effect and the 
restoration of stress-related HPA axis defect independently from a neurogenic 
action.

Evidence suggests that 30-50% of patients suffering from major depressive 
disorder (MDD) are classified as suffering from treatment resistant depression 
(TRD) as they have an inadequate response to standard antidepressants. A key 
feature of this patient population is the increased incidence of co-morbid 
symptoms like anxiety and pain. Recognizing that current standards of care are 
largely focused on monoaminergic mechanisms of action (MOAs), innovative 
approaches to drug discovery for TRD are targeting glutamate hyperfunction. Here 
we describe the in vitro and in vivo profile of GRN-529, a novel negative 
allosteric modulator (NAM) of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). In 
cell based pharmacology assays, GRN-529 is a high affinity (Ki 5.4 nM), potent 
(IC50 3.1 nM) and selective (>1000-fold selective vs mGluR1) mGluR5 NAM. Acute 
administration of GRN-529 (0.1-30 mg/kg p.o.) had dose-dependent efficacy across 
a therapeutically relevant battery of animal models, comprising depression 
(decreased immobility time in tail suspension and forced swim tests) and 2 of 
the co-morbid symptoms overrepresented in TRD, namely anxiety (attenuation of 
stress-induced hyperthermia, and increased punished crossings in the four plate 
test) and pain (reversal of hyperalgesia due to sciatic nerve ligation or 
inflammation). The potential side effect liability of GRN-529 was also assessed 
using preclinical models: GRN-529 had no effect on rat sexual behavior or motor 
co-ordination (rotarod), however it impaired cognition in mice (social odor 
recognition). Efficacy and side effects of GRN-529 were compared to standard of 
care agents (antidepressant, anxiolytic or analgesics) and the tool mGluR5 NAM, 
MTEP. To assess the relationship between target occupancy and efficacy, ex vivo 
receptor occupancy was measured in parallel with efficacy testing. This revealed 
a strong correlation between target engagement, exposure and efficacy across 
behavioral endpoints, which supports the potential translational value of PET 
imaging to dose selection in patients. Collectively this broad spectrum profile 
of efficacy of GRN-529 supports our hypothesis that negative allosteric 
modulation of mGluR5 could represent an innovative therapeutic approach to the 
treatment of TRD. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Metabotropic 
Glutamate Receptors'.

Signal regulatory protein α (SIRPα) is a neuronal membrane protein that 
undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in the brain of mice in response to forced 
swim (FS) stress in cold water, and this response is implicated in regulation of 
depression-like behavior in the FS test. We now show that subjection of mice to 
the FS in warm (37 °C) water does not induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of 
SIRPα in the brain. The rectal temperature (T(rec) ) of mice was reduced to 27° 
to 30 °C by performance of the FS for 10 min in cold water, whereas it was not 
affected by the same treatment in warm water. The level of tyrosine 
phosphorylation of SIRPα in the brain was increased by administration of ethanol 
or picrotoxin, starvation, or cooling after anesthesia, all of which also 
induced hypothermia. Furthermore, the tyrosine phosphorylation of SIRPα in 
cultured hippocampal neurons was induced by lowering the temperature of the 
culture medium. CD47, a ligand of SIRPα, as well as Src family kinases or SH2 
domain-containing protein phosphatase 2 (Shp2), might be important for the basal 
and the hypothermia-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SIRPα. Hypothermia is 
therefore likely an important determinant of both the behavioral immobility and 
tyrosine phosphorylation of SIRPα observed in the FS test.

The objective of the present study was to examine the effect of long-term 
management of insulin resistance and hyperglycemia on neurobehavioral deficits 
in db/db mice. In this study, 5-week-old db/db and lean control mice were fed 
with rosiglitazone (20 mg/kg/day) mixed or standard chow for a duration of 5 
weeks. Mice were monitored weekly for blood glucose concentration. Five weeks 
after the onset of treatment, they were subjected to the forced swim test (FST), 
pre-pulse inhibition (PPI), open field test (OFT) and fear-potentiated startle 
(FPS) test to examine for depression, psychosis-like behavior, locomotor 
activity and emotional learning, respectively. Rosiglitazone normalized 
hyperglycemia and improved glucose tolerance. Rosiglitazone significantly 
reduced immobility time in the FST in db/db mice, suggesting an 
antidepressant-like effect. However, rosiglitazone failed to reverse disruption 
of PPI in db/db mice, indicating its ineffectiveness against psychosis-like 
behavior. In the OFT, rosiglitazone did not affect the activity of db/db mice, 
suggesting its antidepressant-like effect was independent of changes in 
locomotor activity. In the FPS test, db/db mice showed impaired emotional 
learning and rosiglitazone failed to correct it. In conclusion, long-term blood 
glucose management in type-2 diabetics may help to limit the co-occurrence of 
depression but not the psychotic symptoms and ability to cope with stress.

[Effect of antiasthenic drug ladasten on the level of cytokines and behavior in 
experimental model of anxious depression in C57BL/6 male mice].

[Article in Russian]

Tallerova AV, Kovalenko LP, Durnev AD, Seredenin SB.

Effects of the antiasthenic drug ladasten 
[N-(2-adamantyl)-N-(para-bromophenyl)amine] on the profile of cytokines, 
behavior, and indexes of immunity organs was studied on zoosocial stress model 
in depressed C57BL/6 male mice. The anxious depression state in male mice was 
formed by repeated agonistic interactions according to the sensory contact 
model. Ladasten (30 mg/kg, i.p.) and reference drug imipramine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) 
were administered either once after 3-day stressor interaction or for 5 days 
after 10-day interaction. The concentration of cytokines in blood serum was 
determined by flow cytometry method. The behavioral changes were studied using 
an actometer and the elevated plus-maze test. The parameters were studied 24 h 
after last drug injection. Different stages of depression were manifested by 
behavioral impairments, increased concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines 
IL-6, IL-17, and IL-4, and decreased indexes of immunity organs. Ladasten 
induced (more significantly than imipramine) a decrease in the level of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-17 and IL-4, removed behavioral changes, and 
restored indexes of immunity organs. Thus, the antiasthenic drug ladasten limits 
development of the anxious depressive state and suppresses the level 
ofproinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-17 and IL-4. These findings suggest that 
ladasten is a possible candidate drug for adjuvant therapy of depressive 
disorders.

RATIONALE: Ro 64-6198, the prototypical non-peptide nociceptin/orphanin FQ 
peptide (NOP) receptor agonist, has potent anxiolytic-like effects in several 
preclinical models and species. However the effects of Ro 64-6198 on distinctive 
anxiety-provoking conditions related to unconditioned conflict behavior as well 
as its role in despair-like behavior remain to be addressed.
OBJECTIVE: Here we examined the effects of Ro 64-6198 on unconditioned conflict 
anxiety using stimuli with different salience and on regulation of autonomic 
reactivity and compared these to the effects of benzodiazepine receptor 
agonists. We also addressed the potential effects of Ro 64-6198 on despair-like 
behavior.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ro 64-6198 (0.1 to 10 mg/kg i.p.) and either diazepam or 
chlordiazepoxide were tested in the Vogel conflict punished drinking test (VCT) 
in Sprague Dawley rats, in the social approach-avoidance (SAA) test in Lewis 
rats, in the novelty-induced hypophagia (NIH) in C57BL/6J mice, and in 
stress-induced hyperthermia in NMRI mice, as well as in the forced swim test 
(FST) in Sprague Dawley rats and the tail suspension test (TST) in C57BL/6J 
mice.
RESULTS: Ro 64-6198 (0.3 to 3 mg/kg) dose-dependently produced anxiolytic-like 
effects in the VCT, SAA, NIH, and SIH, similar to benzodiazepine receptor 
agonists. Ro 64-6198 did not alter immobility time in the FST and TST.
CONCLUSIONS: Ro 64-6198 produced marked anxiolytic-like effects in response to a 
variety of mild to strong anxiogenic stimuli, whereas it did not facilitate 
depression-related behaviors. This data extend previous literature suggesting 
that NOP receptors are a viable target for the treatment of anxiety disorders.

Pituitary adenylate-cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) has been implicated 
in the (patho)physiology of stress-adaptation. PACAP deficient (PACAP(-/-)) mice 
show altered anxiety levels and depression-like behavior, but little is known 
about the underlying mechanisms in stress-related brain areas. Therefore, we 
aimed at investigating PACAP(-/-) mice in light-dark box, marble burying, open 
field, and forced swim paradigms. We also analyzed whether the forced swim 
test-induced c-Fos expression would be affected by PACAP deficiency in the 
following stress-related brain areas: magno- and parvocellular paraventricular 
nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN); basolateral (BLA), medial (MeA), and central 
(CeA) amygdaloid nuclei; ventral (BSTv), dorsolateral (BSTdl), dorsomedial 
(BSTdm), and oval (BSTov) nuclei of the bed nucleus of stria terminalis; dorsal 
(dLS) and ventral parts (vLS) of lateral septal nucleus, central projecting 
Edinger-Westphal nucleus (EWcp), dorsal (dPAG) and lateral (lPAG) periaqueductal 
gray matter, dorsal raphe nucleus (DR). Our results revealed that PACAP(-/-) 
mice showed greatly reduced anxiety and increased locomotor activity compared 
with wildtypes. In forced swim test PACAP(-/-) mice showed increased 
depression-like behavior. Forced swim exposure increased c-Fos expression in all 
examined brain areas in wildtypes, whereas this was markedly blunted in the DR, 
EWcp, BSTov, BSTdl, BSTv, PVN, vLS, dPAG, and in the lPAG of PACAP(-/-) mice vs. 
wildtypes, strongly suggesting their involvement in the behavioral phenotype of 
PACAP(-/-) mice. PACAP deficiency did not influence the c-Fos response in the 
CeA, MeA, BSTdm, and dLS. Therefore, we propose that PACAP exerts a brain 
area-specific effect on stress-induced neuronal activation and it might 
contribute to stress-related mood disorders.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to play a role in the 
pathophysiology of depression. Taking into account that experimental chronic 
unpredictable stress (CUS) induces depressive-like behavior and that ascorbic 
acid has antidepressant-like effect in animals, the objective of this study was 
to investigate the influence of ascorbic acid on depressive-like behavior 
induced by CUS paradigm, serum corticosterone levels and markers of oxidative 
stress in cerebral cortex and hippocampus of mice. Animals were submitted to CUS 
procedure during 14 days. From the 8th to the 14th day mice received ascorbic 
acid (10 mg/kg) or fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, conventional antidepressant, positive 
control) once a day by oral route. On 15th day behavioral and biochemical 
parameters were analyzed. CUS exposure caused a depressive-like behavior 
evidenced by the increased immobility time in the tail suspension test and 
decreased time in which mice spent grooming in the splash test. Depressive-like 
behavior induced by CUS was accompanied by a significant increased lipid 
peroxidation (cerebral cortex and hippocampus), decreased catalase (CAT) 
(cerebral cortex and hippocampus) and glutathione reductase (GR) (hippocampus) 
activities and reduced levels of glutathione (cerebral cortex). Repeated 
ascorbic acid or fluoxetine administration significantly reversed CUS-induced 
depressive-like behavior and oxidative damage. No alteration was observed in 
locomotor activity, corticosterone levels and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) 
activity. These findings indicate a rapid and robust effect of ascorbic acid in 
reversing behavioral and biochemical alterations induced by CUS in mice, 
suggesting that this vitamin may be an alternative approach for the management 
of depressive symptoms.

Lack of elevations in glucocorticoids correlates with dysphoria-like behavior 
after repeated social defeat.

Activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis is often 
abnormal in depression and could hold clues for better treatment of this 
debilitating disease. However, it has been difficult to use HPA activity as a 
depression biomarker because both HPA hyperactivity and HPA hypoactivity have 
been reported in depression. Melancholic depression has typically been 
associated with HPA hyperactivity, while atypical depression has been linked 
with HPA hypoactivity. Many animal models of chronic stress recapitulate 
behavioral aberrations and elevated HPA activity that could represent a model 
for melancholic depression. However, there are no animal models that could be 
used to elucidate the etiology or treatment of atypical depression. We have used 
repeated social defeat in mice to test the hypothesis that this chronic stress 
would induce dysphoria-like behavior associated with HPA hypoactivity in a 
subset of subjects. Intruder mice were placed in the home cage of an aggressive 
resident mouse for 5 min/d for 30 days. The majority of intruder mice had 
elevated basal plasma corticosterone (High Morning Corticosterone, or HMC) and 
adrenal 11β hydroxylase mRNA levels relative to control mice that were handled 
daily. However, a subset of intruder mice (Low Morning Corticosterone; LMC) 
exhibited basal plasma corticosterone and 11β hydroxylase mRNA levels that were 
indistinguishable from control levels. Significant changes in emotional behavior 
only occurred in LMC mice, which exhibited anxiety-like increases in activity 
and defecation during tail suspension and anhedonia-like decreases in sucrose 
preference. Relative to HMC mice, LMC mice also showed increases in gene 
expression of mineralocorticoid receptor in CA2 hippocampus, consistent with the 
possibility that HPA activity in this group is constrained by increased 
sensitivity to glucocorticoid negative feedback. LMC mice also exhibited 
increased c-fos gene expression compared to HMC mice in the paraventricular 
hypothalamus and lateral septum suggesting that central pathways fail to 
habituate to chronic stress even though adrenocortical activity is not 
stimulated. We conclude that LMC mice showed adrenocortical hyporesponsiveness, 
which in combination with the behavioral abnormalities in this group may 
represent a model for the HPA hypoactivity associated with atypical depression.

Because zinc deficiency induces depression and anxiety-like behavior in rodents, 
we examined the effects of zinc administration in several tests by measuring 
anxiolytic activity in mice and rats. We now report that zinc significantly 
increased the number of entries into the open arms in the elevated plus maze in 
rats. Moreover, zinc treatment significantly increased the number of punished 
crossings in the four-plate test and attenuated stress-induced hyperthermia 
(SIH) in mice. However, no effect of zinc administration was observed in the 
elevated plus maze test in mice. This lack of effect in the latter case was 
probably due to the substantial zinc-induced reduction in locomotor activity by 
the doses used in mice. The present data demonstrate for the first time the 
anxiolytic-like activity of zinc in rodents and may indicate that zinc could be 
used as a novel therapeutic/adjunct agent in anxiolytic therapy.

Major depression is a chronic psychiatric illness that is highly prevalent and 
disabling. The available medications are ineffective for many patients 
suggesting that differents molecular pathways could be specifically altered in 
the unresponsive patients. Recently, the glutamatergic system has emerged as a 
target in the research on depression and acute NMDA receptor blockade has been 
shown to produce strong antidepressant effects. We have studied the adaptations 
of four mice strains (C57BL/6, DBA/2, C3H and BALB/c) to a chronic unpredictable 
stress protocol, a widely used model of depression in rodents. BALB/c mice 
displayed strikingly different behavioral and neurochemical adaptations compared 
to the other strains tested, suggesting that different molecular pathways are 
involved in their specific vulnerability. They became hyperactive during the 
dark period, anhedonic-like and displayed no alterations in the tail suspension 
test (TST). After chronic stress, only the BALB/c displayed an increased 
frontocortical VGLUT1 expression which is suggestive of a dysregulation of their 
prefrontal glutamatergic system, and no BDNF mRNA alteration, although the acute 
stress modulation of this mRNA is similar to the other strains. Chronic 
administration of an antagonist of NMDA receptors, MK-801, induced 
antidepressant-like effects in the TST for stressed BALB/c, but was ineffective 
for the hyperactivity and anhedonia-like behavior, in contrast to fluoxetine. 
Chronic MK-801 was totally inactive on the behavior of stressed C57BL/6 mice. 
MK-801, but not fluoxetine, inhibited the VGLUT1 prefrontal increase in BALB/c. 
Fluoxetine increased VGLUT1 and BDNF mRNA expression in the hippocampus of the 
C57BL/6 but not in the BALB/c strain, suggesting a different reactivity 
in-between strain to both stress and antidepressant. Interestingly enough, the 
BDNF or VGLUT1 increase is not necessary to reverse the stress induced 
behavioral alterations in our experimental settings. This observation supports 
the conclusion that BDNF and VGLUT1 are depressive state markers, but not 
involved in its etiology. Finally, there is a substantial similarity between the 
phenotypes that are observed in the BALB/c mice and endogenous depression in 
humans, as well as between C57BL/6 mice and atypical depression. To have a 
better understanding of the variability of depression etiologies in human, and 
the implication of the glutamatergic system, it may be suggested that future 
animal studies in the mouse would systematically compare the two strains BALB/c 
and C57BL/6 for the identification of relevant biological mechanisms. This 
article is part of a special Issue entitled 'Anxiety and Depression'.

Inhibition of iNOS induces antidepressant-like effects in mice: pharmacological 
and genetic evidence.

Recent evidence has suggested that systemic administration of non-selective NOS 
inhibitors induces antidepressant-like effects in animal models. However, the 
precise involvement of the different NOS isoforms (neuronal-nNOS and 
inducible-iNOS) in these effects has not been clearly defined yet. Considering 
that mediators of the inflammatory response, that are able to induce iNOS 
expression, can be increased by exposure to stress, the aim of the present study 
was to investigate iNOS involvement in stress-induced behavioral consequences in 
the forced swimming test (FST), an animal model sensitive to antidepressant 
drugs. Therefore, we investigated the effects induced by systemic injection of 
aminoguanidine (preferential iNOS inhibitor), 1400W (selective iNOS inhibitor) 
or n-propyl-l-arginine (NPA, selective nNOS inhibitor) in mice submitted to the 
FST. We also investigated the behavior of mice with genetic deletion of iNOS 
(knockout) submitted to the FST. Aminoguanidine significantly decreased the 
immobility time (IT) in the FST. 1400W but not NPA, when administered at 
equivalent doses considering the magnitude of their Ki values for iNOS and nNOS, 
respectively, reduced the IT, thus suggesting that aminoguanidine-induced 
effects would be due to selective iNOS inhibition. Similarly, iNOS KO presented 
decreased IT in the FST when compared to wild-type mice. These results are the 
first to show that selective inhibition of iNOS or its knockdown induces 
antidepressant-like effects, therefore suggesting that iNOS-mediated NO 
synthesis is involved in the modulation of stress-induced behavioral 
consequences. Moreover, they further support NO involvement in the neurobiology 
of depression. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Anxiety and 
Depression'.

Vulnerability of conditional NCAM-deficient mice to develop stress-induced 
behavioral alterations.

Bisaz R(1), Sandi C.

Lausanne, Switzerland.

Previous studies in rodents showed that chronic stress induces structural and 
functional alterations in several brain regions, including shrinkage of the 
hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex, which are accompanied by cognitive and 
emotional disturbances. Reduced expression of the neural cell adhesion molecule 
(NCAM) following chronic stress has been proposed to be crucially involved in 
neuronal retraction and behavioral alterations. Since NCAM gene polymorphisms 
and altered expression of alternatively spliced NCAM isoforms have been 
associated with bipolar depression and schizophrenia in humans, we hypothesized 
that reduced expression of NCAM renders individuals more vulnerable to the 
deleterious effects of stress on behavior. Here, we specifically questioned 
whether mice in which the NCAM gene is inactivated in the forebrain by 
cre-recombinase under the control of the calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase II 
promoter (conditional NCAM-deficient mice), display increased vulnerability to 
stress. We assessed the evolving of depressive-like behaviors and spatial 
learning and memory impairments following a subchronic stress protocol (2 weeks) 
that does not result in behavioral dysfunction, nor in altered NCAM expression, 
in wild-type mice. Indeed, while no behavioral alterations were detected in 
wild-type littermates after subchronic stress, conditional NCAM-deficient mice 
showed increased immobility in the tail suspension test and deficits in reversal 
spatial learning in the water maze. These findings indicate that diminished NCAM 
expression might be a critical vulnerability factor for the development of 
behavioral alterations by stress and further support a functional involvement of 
NCAM in stress-induced cognitive and emotional disturbances.

BACKGROUND: The Hsp90 cochaperone FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5) is an 
established regulator of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and numerous genetic 
studies have linked it to stress-related diseases such as major depression or 
posttraumatic stress disorder. However, translational studies including genetic 
animal models are lacking.
METHODS: Mice deficient of FKBP5 were generated and analyzed in comparison with 
wildtype littermates. They were subjected to several test paradigms 
characterizing their emotionality, stress reactivity, and coping behavior as 
well as hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis function and regulation. Moreover, 
protein expression of GR and FKBP5 was determined in different brain structures 
8 days after stress exposure. The combined dexamethasone/corticotropin-releasing 
hormone test was performed both in mice and healthy human subjects of different 
FKBP5 genotypes. The GR function was evaluated by reporter gene assays.
RESULTS: Under basal conditions, deletion of FKBP5 did not change exploratory 
drive, locomotor activity, anxiety-related behavior, stress-coping, or 
depression-like behavior. After exposure to different acute stressors of 
sufficient intensity, however, it led to a more active coping behavior. 
Moreover, loss of FKBP5 decreased hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis reactivity 
and GR expression changes in response to stressors. In mice and humans, the 
FKBP5 genotype also determined the outcome of the 
dexamethasone/corticotropin-releasing hormone test.
CONCLUSIONS: This study in mice and humans presents FKBP5 as a decisive factor 
for the physiological stress response, shaping neuroendocrine reactivity as well 
as coping behavior. This lends strong support to the concept emerging from human 
studies of FKBP5 as important factor governing gene-environment interactions 
relevant for the etiology of affective disorders.

Psychological stress is a major risk factor for mood and anxiety disorders. 
However, the phenotypic manifestation of stress effects varies across 
individuals, likely due, in part, to genetic variation. Modeling the behavioral 
and neural consequences of stress across genetically diverse inbred mouse 
strains is a valuable approach to studying gene × stress interactions. Recent 
work has shown that C57BL/6J mice exposed to ten daily sessions of restraint 
stress exhibited increased exploration of the aversive light compartment in the 
light/dark exploration (LDE) test. Here we sought to clarify the nature of this 
stress-induced phenotype by testing the ability of treatment with various 
clinically efficacious drugs of different therapeutic classes to rescue it. Ten 
days of restraint increased light compartment exploration, reduced body weight 
and sensitized the corticosterone response to swim stress. Subchronic 
administration (during stress and LDE testing) of fluoxetine, and to a lesser 
extent, lithium chloride, rescued stress-induced LDE behavior. Chronic 
fluoxetine treatment prior to (plus during stress and testing) failed to block 
the LDE stress effect. Acute administration of antipsychotic haloperidol, 
anti-ADHD medication methylphenidate or anxiolytic drug chlordiazepoxide, prior 
to LDE testing, was also unable to normalize the LDE stress effect. 
Collectively, these data demonstrate a treatment-selective prophylactic rescue 
of a restraint stress-induced behavioral abnormality in the C57BL/6J inbred 
strain. Further work with this novel model could help elucidate genetic and 
neural mechanisms mediating stress-induced changes in mouse 'emotion-relevant' 
behaviors and, ultimately, further understanding of the pathophysiology of 
stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders. This article is part of a Special 
Issue entitled 'Anxiety and Depression'.

BACKGROUND: Chronic pain is clinically associated with the development of 
affective disorders. However, studies in animal models of neuropathic pain are 
contradictory and the relationship with mood disorders remains unclear. In this 
study, we aimed to characterize the affective consequences of neuropathic pain 
over time and to study potential underlying mechanisms.
METHODS: Neuropathic pain was induced by inserting a polyethylene cuff around 
the main branch of the right sciatic nerve in C57BL/6J mice. Anxiety- and 
depression-related behaviors were assessed over 2 months, using a battery of 
tests, such as elevated plus maze, marble burying, novelty suppressed feeding, 
splash test, and forced swimming test. Plasma corticosterone levels were 
assessed by radioimmunoassay. We also investigated changes in cyclic adenosine 
monophosphate response element (CRE) activity using CRE-LacZ transgenic mice.
RESULTS: Mice developed anxiety-related behavior 4 weeks after induction of the 
neuropathy, and depression-related behaviors were observed after 6 to 8 weeks. 
Control and neuropathic mice did not differ for basal or stress-induced levels 
of corticosterone or for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis negative feedback. 
After 8 weeks, the CRE-mediated activity decreased in the outer granule layer of 
dentate gyrus of neuropathic mice but not in the amygdala or in the anterior 
cingulate cortex.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that the affective consequences of 
neuropathic pain evolve over time, independently from the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which remains unaffected. CRE-mediated 
transcription within a limbic structure was altered at later time points of the 
neuropathy. These experiments provide a preclinical model to study 
time-dependent development of mood disorders and the underlying mechanism in a 
neuropathic pain context.

Relaxin-3 is a neuropeptide belonging to the relaxin/insulin superfamily. 
Studies using rodents have revealed that relaxin-3 is predominantly expressed in 
neurons in the nucleus incertus (NI) of the pons, the axons of which project to 
forebrain regions including the hypothalamus. There is evidence that relaxin-3 
is involved in several functions, including food intake and stress responses. In 
the present study, we generated relaxin-3 gene knockout (KO) mice and examined 
them using a range of behavioral tests of sensory/motor functions and 
emotion-related behaviors. The results revealed that relaxin-3 KO mice exhibited 
normal growth and appearance, and were generally indistinguishable from wild 
genotype littermates. There was no difference in bodyweight among genotypes 
until at least 28 weeks after birth. In addition, there were no significant 
differences between wild-type and KO mice in locomotor activity, social 
interaction, hot plate test performance, fear conditioning, depression-like 
behavior, and Y-maze test performance. However, in the elevated plus maze test, 
KO mice exhibited a robust increase in the tendency to enter open arms, although 
they exhibited normal performance in a light/dark transition test and showed no 
difference from wild-type mice in the time spent in central area in the open 
field test. On the other hand, a significant increase in the acoustic startle 
response was observed in KO mice. These results indicate that relaxin-3 is 
slightly involved in the anxiety-related behavior.

    Neuropsychopharmacology. 2011 Nov;36(12):2371-2.

Despite the impact of schizophrenia and mood disorders, which in extreme cases 
can lead to death, recent decades have brought little progress in the 
development of new treatments. Recent studies have shown that Reelin, an 
extracellular protein that is critical for neuronal development, is reduced in 
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients. However, data on a causal or 
protective role of Reelin in psychiatric diseases is scarce. In order to study 
the direct influence of Reelin's levels on behavior, we subjected two mouse 
lines, in which Reelin levels are either reduced (Reelin heterozygous mice) or 
increased (Reelin overexpressing mice), to a battery of behavioral tests: 
open-field, black-white box, novelty-suppressed-feeding, forced-swim-test, 
chronic corticosterone treatment followed by forced-swim-test, cocaine 
sensitization and pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) deficits induced by 
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists. These tests were designed to model some 
aspects of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, mood, and anxiety 
disorders. We found no differences between Reeler heterozygous mice and their 
wild-type littermates. However, Reelin overexpression in the mouse forebrain 
reduced the time spent floating in the forced-swim-test in mice subjected to 
chronic corticosterone treatment, reduced behavioral sensitization to cocaine, 
and reduced PPI deficits induced by a NMDA antagonist. In addition, we 
demonstrate that while stress increased NMDA NR2B-mediated synaptic 
transmission, known to be implicated in depression, Reelin overexpression 
significantly reduced it. Together, these results point to the Reelin signaling 
pathway as a relevant drug target for the treatment of a range of psychiatric 
disorders.

Antidepressant and proneurogenic influence of environmental enrichment in mice: 
protective effects vs recovery.

Institute, CSIC, Madrid, Spain.

Physical-cognitive activity has long-lasting beneficial effects on the brain and 
on behavior. Environmental enrichment (EE) induces brain activity known to 
influence the behavior of mice, as measured in learned helplessness paradigms 
(forced swim test), and neurogenic cell populations in the hippocampal dentate 
gyrus. However, it is not completely clear whether the antidepressant and 
proneurogenic effects of EE are different in animals that are naive or 
pre-exposed to the stress inducing helplessness, and if this depends on the type 
of stressor. It also remains unclear whether differential effects are exerted on 
distinct neurogenic subpopulations. We found that EE has a protective effect in 
adult female mice (C57BL/6J) when exposed twice to the same stressor (forced 
swim test) but it has no influence on recovery. The repeated exposure to this 
stressor was analyzed together with the effects of EE on different neurogenic 
populations distinguished by age and differentiation state. Younger cells are 
more sensitive and responsive to the conditions, both the positive and negative 
effects. These results are relevant to identify the cell populations that are 
the targets of stress, depression, and enrichment, and that form part of the 
mechanism responsible for mood dysfunctions.

Targeting the BH3-interacting domain death agonist to develop mechanistically 
unique antidepressants.

The BH3-interacting domain death agonist (Bid) is a pro-apoptotic member of the 
B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) protein family. Previous studies have shown that 
stress reduces levels of Bcl-2 in brain regions implicated in the 
pathophysiology of mood disorders, whereas antidepressants and mood stabilizers 
increase Bcl-2 levels. The Bcl-2 protein family has an essential role in 
cellular resilience as well as synaptic and neuronal plasticity and may 
influence mood and affective behaviors. This study inhibited Bid in mice using 
two pharmacological antagonists (BI-11A7 and BI-2A7); the selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitor citalopram was used as a positive control. These agents were 
studied in several well-known rodent models of depression-the forced swim test 
(FST), the tail suspension test (TST), and the learned helplessness (LH) 
paradigm-as well as in the female urine sniffing test (FUST), a measure of 
sex-related reward-seeking behavior. Citalopram and BI-11A7 both significantly 
reduced immobility time in the FST and TST and attenuated escape latencies in 
mice that underwent the LH paradigm. In the FUST, both agents significantly 
improved duration of female urine sniffing in mice that had developed 
helplessness. LH induction increased the activation of apoptosis-inducing factor 
(AIF), a caspase-independent cell death constituent activated by Bid, and 
mitochondrial AIF expression was attenuated by chronic BI-11A7 infusion. Taken 
together, the results suggest that functional perturbation of apoptotic proteins 
such as Bid and, alternatively, enhancement of Bcl-2 function, is a putative 
strategy for developing novel therapeutics for mood disorders.

behavior in male mice subjected to unpredictable chronic mild stress.

BACKGROUND: Accumulating epidemiological evidence shows that life event 
stressors are major vulnerability factors for psychiatric diseases such as major 
depression. It is also well known that social isolation in male mice results in 
aggressive behavior. However, it is not known how social isolation-induced 
aggression affects anxiety and depressive-like behavior in isolated male mice 
subjected to unpredictable chronic mild stress (CMS), an animal model of 
depression.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: C57/B6 male mice were divided into 3 groups; 
non-stressed controls, in Group I; isolated mice subjected to the CMS protocol 
in Group II and aggression by physical contact in socially isolated mice 
subjected to the CMS protocol in Group III. In the sucrose intake test, 
ingestion of a 1% sucrose solution by mice in Groups II and III was 
significantly lower than in Group I. Furthermore, intake of this solution in 
Group III mice was significantly lower than in Group II mice. In the open field 
test, mice in Group III, showed reduced locomotor activity and reduced entry and 
retention time in the central zone, compared to Groups I and II mice. Moreover, 
the distances moved in 1 hour by Group III mice did not differ between night and 
morning. In the light/black box test, Groups II and III animals spent 
significantly less time in the light box compared to Group I animals. In the 
tail suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test (FST), the immobility times 
of Group II and Group III mice were significantly longer than in Group I mice. 
In addition, immobility times in the FST were significantly longer in Group III 
than in Group II mice.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings show that social isolation-induced 
aggression could potentiate anxiety and depressive-like behaviors in isolated 
male mice subjected to CMS.

The behavioral phenotype of a transgenic mouse overexpressing a galanin receptor 
2 (GalR2)-enhanced, green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-construct under the 
platelet-derived growth factor-B promoter, and of controls, was assessed in 
various behavioral tests, such as the Porsolt forced swim test, as well as the 
open field, elevated plus maze and passive avoidance tests. In addition, the 
distribution of GalR2-EGFP expressing cell bodies and processes was studied in 
the brain of these mice using histochemical methods. Three age groups of the 
transgenic mice demonstrated decreased levels of immobility in the forced swim 
test, indicative of antidepressive-like behavior and/or increased stress 
resistance. Anxiety-like behaviors, measured in two different tests, did not 
differ between the GalR2-overexpressing and the wild-type mice, nor did motor 
activity levels, emotional learning or memory behaviors. High levels of GalR2 
mRNA and protein expression were observed in the presubiculum, subiculum, 
cingulate cortex, retrosplenial granular and agranular cortices, subregions of 
prefrontal cortex, and the olfactory bulb, regions which are directly or 
indirectly implicated in depression-like behavior. These results may contribute 
to the understanding of the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder and the 
role of GalR2 in the regulation of mood, and suggest a potential therapeutic 
effect by targeting the GalR2 for treatment of depressive disorders.

Antidepressant-like effect of a Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb761) in the mouse 
forced swimming test: role of oxidative stress.

EGb761 is a well-defined mixture of active compounds extracted from Ginkgo 
biloba leaves. This extract is used clinically due to its neuroprotective 
effects, exerted probably via its potent antioxidant or free radical scavenger 
action. Previous studies suggest that oxidative stress, via free radical 
production, may play an important role in depression and animal models for 
depression-like behavior. Preclinical studies have suggested that antioxidants 
may have antidepressants properties. The aim of this study was to investigate 
the antidepressant-like of EGb761 due to its antioxidant role against oxidative 
stress induced in the forced swimming test, the most widely used preclinical 
model for assessing antidepressant-like behavior. Male BALB/c mice were 
pretreated with EGb761 (10mg/kg, ip) daily for 17 days followed by the forced 
swimming test and spontaneous locomotor activity. Animals were sacrificed to 
evaluate lipid peroxidation, different antioxidant enzyme activities, serotonin 
and dopamine content in midbrain, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. EGb761 
significantly decreased the immobility time (39%) in the forced swimming test. 
This antidepressant-like effect of EGb761 was associated with a reduction in 
lipid peroxidation and superoxide radical production (indicated by a 
downregulation of Mn-superoxide dismutase activity), both of which are 
indicators of oxidative stress. The protective effect of EGb761 is not related 
to excitatory or inhibitory effects in locomotor activity, and was also 
associated with the modulation of serotonergic and dopaminergic 
neurotransmission. It is suggested that EGb761 produces an antidepressant-like 
effect, and that an antioxidant effect against oxidative stress may be partly 
responsible for its observed neuroprotective effects.

Differences in mouse maternal care behavior - is there a genetic impact of the 
glucocorticoid receptor?

B, Gass P.

Depressive episodes are frequently preceded by stressful life events. Evidence 
from genetic association studies suggests a role for the glucocorticoid receptor 
(GR), an essential element in the regulation of stress responses, in the 
pathophysiology of the disorder. Since the stress response system is affected by 
pregnancy and postpartum-associated changes, it has also been implicated in the 
pathophysiology of postpartum depression. Using a 2 × 2 factorial design, we 
investigated whether a heterozygous deletion of GR would influence maternal care 
behavior in C57BL/6 and Balb/c mice, two inbred strains known to display 
qualitative differences in this behavior. Behavioral observation was carried out 
between postnatal days 1 and 7, followed by a pup retrieval test on postnatal 
days 7 or 8. While previously noted inter-strain differences were confirmed for 
different manifestations of caring behavior, self-maintenance and neglecting 
behaviors as well as the pup retrieval test, no strain-independent effect of the 
GR mutation was noted. However, an interaction between GR genotype and 
licking/grooming behavior was observed: it was down-regulated in heterozygous 
C57BL/6 mice to the level recorded for Balb/c mice. Home cage observation poses 
minimal disturbance of the dam and her litter as compared to more invasive 
assessments of dams' emotional behavior. This might be a reason for the absence 
of any overall effects of the GR mutation, particularly since GR heterozygous 
animals display a depressive-like phenotype under stressful conditions only. 
Still, the subtle effect we observed may point towards a role of GR in 
postpartum affective disorders.

Resistance to early-life stress in mice: effects of genetic background and 
stress duration.

University College Cork Cork, Ireland.

Early-life stress can induce marked behavioral and physiological impairments in 
adulthood including cognitive deficits, depression, anxiety, and 
gastrointestinal dysfunction. Although robust rat models of early-life stress 
exist there are few established effective paradigms in the mouse. Genetic 
background and protocol parameters used are two critical variables in such model 
development. Thus we investigated the impact of two different early-life stress 
protocols in two commonly used inbred mouse strains. C57BL/6 and innately 
anxious BALB/c male mice were maternally deprived 3 h daily, either from 
postnatal day 1 to 14 (protocol 1) or 6 to 10 (protocol 2). Animals were 
assessed in adulthood for cognitive performance (spontaneous alternation 
behavior test), anxiety [open-field, light/dark box (L/DB), and elevated plus 
maze (EPM) tests], and depression-related behaviors (forced swim test) in 
addition to stress-sensitive physiological changes. Overall, the results showed 
that early-life stressed mice from both strains displayed good cognitive ability 
and no elevations in anxiety. However, paradoxical changes occurred in C57BL/6 
mice as the longer protocol (protocol 1) decreased anxiety in the L/DB and 
increased exploration in the EPM. In BALB/c mice there were also limited effects 
of maternal separation with both separation protocols inducing reductions in 
stress-induced defecation and protocol 1 reducing the colon length. These data 
suggest that, independent of stress duration, mice from both strains were on the 
whole resilient to the maladaptive effects of early-life stress. Thus maternal 
separation models of brain-gut axis dysfunction should rely on either different 
stressor protocols or other strains of mice.

[Experimental study of antidepressant effects of GB-115 dipeptide].

[Article in Russian]

Kolik LG.

It was previously reported that GB-115 [Ph(CH2)5CO-Gly-D-Trp-NH2], a 
tryptophan-containing dipeptide analog of endogenous CCK4, exhibited pronounced 
anxiolytic effects in behavioral models of anxiety targeted on the "passive" 
phenotype of the emotional stress reaction. The aim of the present work was to 
study the modulator action of GB-115 (0.0125-0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) on emotional 
processes in both mongrel and inbred (BALB/c and C57B1/6) mice with opposite 
emotionality in Porsolt's test. GB-115 injected at a dose of 0.025 mg/kg led to 
a decrease in the immobilization time in all animals tested. The effect observed 
was less potent than that of amitriptyline (10 mg/kg). In contrast to the case 
of BALB/c mice, GB-115 increased the latent period in both C57B1/6 mice with 
active type of behavior and in mongrel mice. There were no changes in 
spontaneous locomotor activity after the acute administration of GB-115 in 
inbred and mongrel mice. It was found that GB-115 at an anxiolytic dose produced 
antidepressant-like effects independently of the genetically controlled 
emotional stress reaction phenotype. These results indicate that the novel 
dipeptide analog of CCK4 may have potential in the clinical management of 
concurrent anxiety and depression.

Unipolar depression and bipolar depression are prevalent and debilitating 
diseases in need of effective novel treatments. It is becoming increasingly 
evident that depressive disorders manifest from a combination of inherited 
susceptibility genes and environmental stress. Genetic mutations resulting in 
decreased neuronal Na(+) ,K(+) -ATPase (sodium-potassium adenosine 
triphosphatase) activity may put individuals at risk for depression given that 
decreased Na(+) ,K(+) -ATPase activity is observed in depressive disorders and 
animal models of depression. Here, we show that Na(+) ,K(+) -ATPase α3 
heterozygous mice (Atp1a3(+/-) ), with 15% reduced neuronal Na(+) ,K(+) -ATPase 
activity, are vulnerable to develop increased depression-like endophenotypes in 
a chronic variable stress (CVS) paradigm compared to wild-type littermates 
(Atp1a3(+/+) ). In Atp1a3(+/+) mice CVS did not decrease Na(+) ,K(+) -ATPase 
activity, however led to despair-like behavior in the tail suspension test 
(TST), anhedonia in a sucrose preference test and a minimal decrease in 
sociability, whereas in Atp1a3(+/-) mice CVS decreased neuronal Na(+) ,K(+) 
-ATPase activity to 33% of wild-type levels, induced despair-like behavior in 
the TST, anhedonia in a sucrose preference test, anxiety in the elevated plus 
maze, a memory deficit in a novel object recognition task and sociability 
deficits in a social interaction test. We found that a mutation that decreases 
neuronal Na(+) ,K(+) -ATPase activity interacts with stress to exacerbate 
depression. Furthermore, we observed an interesting correlation between Na(+) 
,K(+) -ATPase activity and mood that may relate to both unipolar depression and 
bipolar disorder. Pharmaceuticals that increase Na(+) ,K(+) -ATPase activity or 
block endogenous Na(+) , K(+) -ATPase inhibition may provide effective treatment 
for depressive disorders and preclude depression in susceptible individuals.

some biological functions such as hormonal systems may dramatically change in 
pregnancy. Some of them may be exposed to strong stress as hesitation of 
positive drug therapies because of worries regarding adverse effects on the 
embryo. A growing body of evidence suggests that prenatal stress increases the 
vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety. 
However, the mechanisms involved are still unknown. To clarify the influence of 
exposure to prenatal stress on emotional development, we examined behavioral 
responses in offspring exposed to weak- or strong-prenatal restraint stress. We 
found that offspring that had been exposed to strong stress displayed 
anxiety-like behavior as determined by the elevated plus-maze test. It has been 
widely accepted that central serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) neurons play 
a critical role in emotional behaviors. Immunohistochemical studies showed that 
exposure to strong-prenatal restraint stress increased the expression of 
5-HT-positive cells in the dorsal raphe nuclei in mice. Moreover, under these 
conditions, tryptophan hydroxylase-like immunoreactivities were also 
dramatically increased. In contrast, these behavioral and neurochemical 
abnormalities were not observed in offspring that had been exposed to 
weak-prenatal restraint stress. These findings indicate that exposure to 
excessive prenatal stress induces anxiety-like behavior together with disruption 
of the development of 5-HT neurons in mice.

Total saponins extracted from the caudexes and leaves of Panax notoginseng 
(SCLPN) have been used in the clinic for improving mental function, treating 
insomnia, and alleviating anxiety. The present study evaluated the potential 
antidepressant activity of SCLPN in rodent models of depression and the 
mechanism of action of SCLPN. Mice were received SCLPN at doses of 10-1000 mg/kg 
daily for 1, 7, and 14 days and then were subjected to the forced swim test and 
locomotor activity test. The results showed that SCLPN decreased immobility time 
in the forced swim test, with little effect on locomotion. In the chronic mild 
stress model, chronic SCLPN treatment (70 mg/kg) reversed the rats' 
depression-like behavior. Furthermore, SCLPN exerted its antidepressant-like 
effect by increasing the levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine, dopamine, and 
noradrenaline. Additionally, SCLPN treatment reduced intracellular Ca(2+) in 
cultured neurons. The present study suggests that SCLPN may function as an 
antidepressant, and the antidepressant-like effects of SCLPN may be mediated by 
modulation of brain monoamine neurotransmitters and intracellular Ca(2+) 
concentration.

BACKGROUND: Extracts of Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort) have been 
traditionally recommended for a wide range of medical conditions, in particular 
mild-to-moderate depression. The present study was designed to investigate the 
effect of Hypericum perforatum treatment in a mouse model of 
anxiety/depressive-like behavior, induced by chronic corticosterone 
administration.
METHODS: CD1 mice were submitted to 7 weeks corticosterone administration and 
then behavioral tests as Open Field (OF), Novelty-Suppressed Feeding (NSF), 
Forced Swim Test (FST) were performed. Cell proliferation in hippocampal dentate 
gyrus (DG) was investigated by both 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) and 
doublecortin (DCX) immunohistochemistry techniques and stereological procedure 
was used to quantify labeled cells. Golgi-impregnation method was used to 
evaluate changes in dendritic spines in DG. Hypericum perforatum (30 mg/Kg) has 
been administered for 3 weeks and then neural development in the adult 
hippocampus and behavioral changes have been examined.
RESULTS: The anxiety/depressive-like state due to chronic corticosterone 
treatment was reversed by exogenous administration of Hypericum perforatum; the 
proliferation of progenitor cells in mice hippocampus was significantly reduced 
under chronic corticosterone treatment, whereas a long term treatment with 
Hypericum perforatum prevented the corticosterone-induced decrease in 
hippocampal cell proliferation. Corticosterone-treated mice exhibited a reduced 
spine density that was ameliorated by Hypericum perforatum administration.
CONCLUSION: These results provide evidence of morphological adaptations 
occurring in mature hippocampal neurons that might underlie resilient responses 
to chronic stress and contribute to the therapeutic effects of chronic Hypericum 
perforatum treatment.

Evidence for a key role of the peripheral kynurenine pathway in the modulation 
of anxiety- and depression-like behaviours in mice: focus on individual 
differences.

We previously reported that confronting mice to the Unpredictable Chronic Mild 
Stress procedure (UCMS) resulted in peripheral and cerebral alterations of the 
kynurenine pathway (KP). The present study tested whether KP disturbances are 
associated with differences in anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors in both 
naïve and UCMS mice. Non-stressed and UCMS mice were subjected to the elevated 
plus maze test and to the forced swim test. Mice were then sacrificed for 
quantification of tryptophan (TRP)-serotonin (5-HT) and TRP-kynurenine (KYN) 
metabolites in two corticolimbic structures involved in the regulation of mood 
(cingulate cortex=CC; amygdala=AMY). We showed that an elevated peripheral 
(lung) KYN/TRP ratio is correlated to the magnitude of anxiodepressive-like 
phenotypes only in UCMS mice. We also observed, in UCMS mice, that a high 
peripheral (lung) KYN/TRP ratio is associated with an increased metabolism of 
5-HT in CC and a reduced level of kynurenic acid (KYNA) in AMY. Our results 
suggest that elevated peripheral KP might underlie cerebral biochemical changes 
and might consequently be involved in the modulation of behavior but only in 
UCMS mice. These findings make more complete the comprehension of the KP 
involvement in behavioral changes induced by chronic stress and suggest that it 
could play a crucial role in the modulation of emotional states.

Neuropeptide Y (NPY) has been extensively studied in relation to anxiety and 
depression but of the seven NPY receptors known to date, it is not yet clear 
which one is mainly involved in mediating its effects in emotional behavior. 
Mice lacking the NPY-Y2 receptors were previously shown to be less anxious due 
to their improved ability to cope with stressful situations. In the present 
study, the behavioral phenotype including the response to challenges was 
analyzed in NPY-Y2 knockout (KO) mice backcrossed in to congenic C57BL/6 
background. In the elevated plus-maze (EPM) and the forced swim test (FST), the 
anxiolytic-like or antidepressant-like phenotype of the NPY-Y2 KO mice could not 
be confirmed, although this study differs from the previous one only with regard 
to the genetic background of the mice. In addition, no differences in response 
to acute stress or to the antidepressant desipramine in the FST were detected 
between wild type (WT) and NPY-Y2 KO animals. These results suggest that the 
genetic background of the animals appears to have a strong influence on the 
behavioral phenotype of NPY-Y2 KO mice. Additionally, to further characterize 
the animals by their biochemical response to a challenge, the neurochemical 
changes induced by the anxiogenic compound yohimbine were measured in the medial 
prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of NPY-Y2 KO and compared to WT mice. Dopamine (DA) 
levels were significantly increased by yohimbine in the WT but unaffected in the 
KO mice, suggesting that NPY-Y2 receptor exerts a direct control over both the 
tonic and phasic release of DA and that, although the anxiety-like behavior of 
these NPY-Y2 KO mice is unaltered, there are clear modifications of DA dynamics. 
However, yohimbine led to a significant increase in noradrenaline (NA) 
concentration and a slight reduction in serotonin concentration that were 
identical for both phenotypes.

Modulation of serotonin transporter (5-HTT) function causes changes in affective 
behavior, both in humans and rodents. Stressful life events likewise affect 
emotional behavior. In humans, a low-expressing genetic 5-htt variant, the s 
allele of the 5-htt linked promoter region, has been associated with increased 
risk for depression only where there was a history of stressful life events. To 
investigate this gene by environment interaction in mice, we compared the 
effects of inescapable shocks on the behavior of wild-type (5-htt+/+), 
heterozygote (5-htt+/-) and serotonin transporter deficient (5-htt-/-) mice. 
Inescapable shocks induce behavioral changes including a shock escape deficit, 
in a subsequent test when escape is possible. Confirming a gene by environment 
interaction, we found that stress increases escape latencies in a gene-dose 
dependent manner (5-htt-/->5-htt+/->5-htt +/+), where as there were no 
differences among the genotypes in the unstressed condition. The vulnerability 
to increased escape latency could not be accounted for by enhanced fear 
learning, as 5-htt-/- mice did not show heightened fear conditioning. The 
interaction of 5-htt genotype and stress appeared to produce a selective 
behavioral vulnerability, because no interaction of 5-htt genotype and stress 
was observed in other measures of anxiety and depression-linked behavior, 
including the open field, novelty suppressed feeding, and forced swim tests. We 
replicated prior findings that the 5-htt-/- displays heightened anxiety and 
depression-like behavior at baseline (unstressed condition). In conclusion, our 
data offer the possibility for future investigation of the neural basis 
underlying 5-htt genotype-by-stress interaction shown here.

Ovarian hormones exert anti-depressive and anxiolytic actions. In this study we 
have analyzed the effects of ovariectomy on the development of anxiety and 
depression-like behaviors and on cell proliferation in the hippocampus of mice 
submitted to chronic unpredictable stress. Animals submitted to stress 4 months 
after ovariectomy showed a significant increase in immobility behavior in the 
forced swimming test compared to animals submitted to stress 2 weeks after 
ovariectomy. In addition, long-term ovariectomy resulted in a significant 
decrease on the time spent in the open arms in the elevated plus-maze test 
compared to control animals. Stress did not significantly affect cell 
proliferation in the hilus of the dentate gyrus. However, ovariectomy resulted 
in a significant decrease in cell proliferation. These results indicate that 
long-term deprivation of ovarian hormones enhances the effect of chronic 
unpredictable stress on depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors in mice. 
Therefore, a prolonged deprivation of ovarian hormones may represent a risk 
factor for the development of depressive and anxiety symptoms after the exposure 
to stressful experiences.

Recent clinical studies demonstrate that serum levels of brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are significantly decreased in patients with major 
depressive disorder (MDD) and that antidepressant treatments reverse this 
effect, indicating that serum BDNF is a biomarker of MDD. These findings raise 
the possibility that serum BDNF may also have effects on neuronal activity and 
behavior, but the functional significance of altered serum BDNF is unknown. To 
address this issue, we determined the influence of peripheral BDNF 
administration on depression- and anxiety-like behavior, including the forced 
swim test (FST), chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)/anhedonia, novelty-induced 
hypophagia (NIH) test, and elevated-plus maze (EPM). Furthermore, we examined 
adult hippocampal neurogenesis as well as hippocampal and striatal expression of 
BDNF, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and cAMP response 
element-binding protein (CREB), in order to determine whether peripherally 
administered BDNF produces antidepressant-like cellular responses in the brain. 
Peripheral BDNF administration increased mobility in the FST, attenuated the 
effects of CUS on sucrose consumption, decreased latency in the NIH test, and 
increased time spent in the open arms of an EPM. Moreover, adult hippocampal 
neurogenesis was increased after chronic, peripheral BDNF administration. We 
also found that BDNF levels as well as expression of pCREB and pERK were 
elevated in the hippocampus of adult mice receiving peripheral BDNF. Taken 
together, these results indicate that peripheral/serum BDNF may not only 
represent a biomarker of MDD, but also have functional consequences on molecular 
signaling substrates, neurogenesis, and behavior.

Severe stress induces changes in neuronal function that are implicated in 
stress-related disorders such as depression. The molecular mechanisms underlying 
the response of the brain to stress remain primarily unknown, however. Signal 
regulatory protein alpha (SIRPalpha) is an Ig-superfamily protein that undergoes 
tyrosine phosphorylation and binds the protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp2. Here 
we show that mice expressing a form of SIRPalpha that lacks most of the 
cytoplasmic region manifest prolonged immobility (depression-like behavior) in 
the forced swim (FS) test. FS stress induced marked tyrosine phosphorylation of 
SIRPalpha in the brain of wild-type mice through activation of Src family 
kinases. The SIRPalpha ligand CD47 was important for such SIRPalpha 
phosphorylation, and CD47-deficient mice also manifested prolonged immobility in 
the FS test. Moreover, FS stress-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of both the 
NR2B subunit of the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptor and the K+-channel 
subunit Kvbeta2 was regulated by SIRPalpha. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation of 
SIRPalpha is important for regulation of depression-like behavior in the 
response of the brain to stress.

Functional relevance of serotonin 2C receptor mRNA editing in antidepressant- 
and anxiety-like behaviors.

Serotonin 2C receptors (5-HT(2C)R) have been shown to undergo 
post-transcriptional RNA editing. This modification affects the affinity, 
coupling and constitutive activity of the receptor. In vivo, manipulations such 
as stress or antidepressant administration dramatically modify the pattern of 
5-HT(2C)R mRNA editing, suggesting that this phenomenon might be involved in the 
pathophysiology of stress-related disorders. Indeed, alterations of 5-HT(2C)R 
mRNA editing have been observed in depressed patients. Thus, the recent 
development of mice expressing either the non-edited (5-HT(2C)R-INI) or the 
fully-edited form of 5-HT(2C)R (5-HT(2C)R-VGV) provides a novel opportunity to 
investigate the relevance of this phenomenon in the context of stress-related 
disorders. We observed that both 5-HT(2C)R-INI and 5-HT(2C)R-VGV mice exhibit 
exaggerated anxiety-like behaviors in the elevated-plus maze paradigm. This 
phenotype was observed when the INI or VGV mutations were present in mice on a 
BALB/c background, as well as non-significant trends in the same direction in 
mice on a C57BL/6J background. In animal models of antidepressant-like activity, 
the absence of editing of 5-HT(2C)R mRNA (5-HT(2C)R-INI) induced an increase in 
the time spent immobile in the forced-swim test (FST) and tail suspension test 
(TST). Complete editing of 5-HT(2C) receptor mRNA (5-HT(2C)R-VGV) induced 
antidepressant-like behavior in the FST and TST, as reflected by a significant 
decrease in time spent immobile. These phenotypes were unrelated to alterations 
in locomotor activity in both 5-HT(2C)R-INI and 5-HT(2C)R-VGV. In the TST, these 
phenotypes were accompanied by a decrease and an increase in response to 
desipramine in 5-HT(2C)R-INI and 5-HT(2C)R-VGV, respectively. These data 
constitute the first in vivo demonstration of a role for 5-HT(2C)R mRNA editing 
in anxiety- and depression-related behaviors.

Early social enrichment provided by communal nest increases resilience to 
depression-like behavior more in female than in male mice.

Early experiences produce persistent changes in behavior and brain function. 
Being reared in a communal nest (CN), consisting of a single nest where three 
mouse mothers keep their pups together and share care-giving behavior from birth 
to weaning, provides an highly stimulating social environment to the developing 
pup since both mother-offspring and peer-to-peer interactions are markedly 
increased. Here we show that being reared in a CN affects adult behavior of CD-1 
mice in a gender-dependent fashion, with reduced depression-like responses in 
females and increased anxiety-like behavior in males. In particular, CN females 
showed higher sucrose preference at baseline condition, drinking more sweet 
solution compared to female mice reared in a standard laboratory condition (SN). 
In the isolation test, both SN and CN females showed a reduction in sucrose 
preference after exposure to isolation stress. However, after 24h, only CN 
females significantly recovered. Finally, in the forced swim test, compared to 
SN, CN females spent longer time floating, a behavioral response that in the CN 
model has been inversely associated with display of endophenotypes of 
depression. With regard to the emotional response, CN males displayed an 
increased anxiety-like behavior in comparison to SN, spending less time in the 
open arms and displaying reduced head-dippings in the elevated plus-maze test. 
No difference was found in females. Overall, our findings show that gender and 
early experiences interact in modulating adult behavior. In particular, we show 
that early experiences modified developmental trajectories shaping adult 
endophenotypes of depression more markedly in females than in males.

The relationship between depression and monoaminergic systems has been 
hypothesized for many years. In this study, we have investigated the possible 
antidepressant-like effect of scopoletin, a coumarin from Polygala sabulosa in 
the tail suspension test and forced swimming test. Moreover, the ability of 
scopoletin to reverse the depression-like behavior in the forced swimming test 
induced by immobility stress in mice was evaluated. Scopoletin reduced the 
immobility time in the tail suspension test (10-100mg/kg, p.o.), but not in the 
forced swimming test. Fluoxetine (positive control) decreased the immobility 
time in the forced swimming and tail suspension tests (20mg/kg, p.o. and 
10mg/kg. p.o., respectively). Immobility stress caused an increase in the 
immobility time in the forced swimming test (depression-like behavior), which 
was reversed by scopoletin (1-100mg/kg, p.o.) and fluoxetine (10mg/kg, p.o.). 
Scopoletin produced no psychostimulant effect in the open-field test. The 
pretreatment of mice with ketanserin (5mg/kg, i.p., a preferential 5-HT(2A) 
receptor antagonist), prazosin (1mg/kg, i.p., an alpha(1)-adrenoceptor 
antagonist), yohimbine (1mg/kg, i.p., an alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist), 
haloperidol (0.2mg/kg, i.p., a dopaminergic receptor antagonist), SCH23390 (0.05 
mg/kg, s.c., a dopamine D(1) receptor antagonist) or sulpiride (50mg/kg, i.p., a 
dopamine D(2) receptor antagonist), but not WAY100635 (0.1mg/kg, s.c., a 
selective 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist) prevented the antidepressant-like effect 
of scopoletin (10mg/kg, p.o.) in the tail suspension test. The results indicate 
that its antidepressant-like effect is dependent on the serotonergic (5-HT(2A) 
receptors), noradrenergic (alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-adrenoceptors) and 
dopaminergic (dopamine D(1) and D(2) receptors) systems.

Hyperactivity and enhanced curiosity of mice expressing PKB/SGK-resistant 
glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3).

Germany.

BACKGROUND: Mounting evidence suggests that bipolar disorder symptoms could be 
favorably influenced by modification of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) 
activity. Specifically, the well known antimanic and mood stabilizing 
medications lithium, valproate, olanzapine and clozapine have been shown to 
inhibit GSK-3 activity. GSK-3 is phosphorylated and thus inhibited by protein 
kinase B (PKB/Akt) and serum and glucocorticoid inducible kinase (SGK) isoforms. 
The present study explored, whether PKB/SGK-dependent GSK-3 regulation 
influences the behavior of mice.
METHODS: Gene-targeted knockin mice with mutated and thus PKB/SGK-resistant 
GSK-3alpha, beta (gsk-3(KI)) were compared to corresponding wild type mice 
(gsk-3(WT)). The mice were analyzed by open-field, light-dark (LD-) box, O-maze, 
emergence test, object exploration test and forced swimming test (FST).
RESULTS: In open-field, LD-box and O-maze, gsk-3(KI) mice displayed a 
hyperactive and more curious phenotype when compared to wild type mice. Speed 
and total distance moved as well as rearings were significantly increased in 
gsk-3(KI) compared to gsk-3(WT) mice. In the O-maze, gsk-3(KI) mice tended to 
travel a larger distance in the open, unprotected area thangsk-3(WT) mice, and 
performed significantly more unprotected head dips suggesting decreased anxiety 
behavior. In the forced swimming test, the immobility time was significantly 
decreased in gsk-3(KI) mice indicating a phenotype less prone to depression. 
Moreover, gsk-3(KI)mice were less sensitive to the application of chronic mild 
stress and showed a decreased HPA axis activity.
CONCLUSIONS: The present observations disclose a significant role of 
PKB/SGK-dependent regulation of GSK-3 in the control of activity, anxiety and 
proneness to depression. Accordingly, mice expressing SGK/PKB resistant GSK-3 
may be a valuable model of hyperactivity and mania.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the roles of estrogen and kalirin-7 in chronic 
restraint stress (CRS)-induced depression and the pathophysiological mechanism 
of depression.
METHODS: Healthy female mice from Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) were 
randomly divided into 3 groups: control group, CRS group, and estrogen + CRS 
group. CRS was used to establish the animal model of depression. Forced swimming 
test and immunohistochemistry method were utilized to investigate the animal 
behavior and kalirin-7 expression in the hippocampus, respectively.
RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the CRS mice displayed depression-like 
behaviors, including a significant reduction in body weight, a significant 
increase in immobility time in forced swimming test, and a dramatic decrease in 
kalirin-7 expression in the hippocampus. However, administration of estrogen 
attenuated the CRS-induced negative behaviors, and simultaneously increased 
kalirin-7 expression.
CONCLUSION: Estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) could prevent CRS-induced 
depression-like behaviors in female ICR mice. Besides, kalirin-7 also plays a 
role in preventing CRS-induced depression-like behaviors.

We found that CS mice exhibit an extremely low immobility time (almost no 
immobility) in both the tail suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test 
(FST). In these tests, animals are subjected to the short-term, inescapable 
stress of being suspended by their tail or being forced to swim in a 
water-filled cylinder. In such situations, the animals rapidly adopt a 
characteristic immobile posture that has been named "behavioral despair" on the 
assumption that the animals have given up hope of escaping. These tests have 
been widely used for assessing antidepressant activity and depression-like 
behavior. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping using CS and C57BL/6J mice 
revealed significant QTLs on chromosomes (Chrs) 4 (FST) and 5 (TST and FST). To 
identify the quantitative trait gene on Chr 5, we narrowed the QTL interval to 
0.5 Mb using several congenic and subcongenic strains. Ubiquitin-specific 
peptidase 46 (Usp46) with a lysine codon deletion was located in this region. 
This deletion affected nest-building, muscimol-induced righting reflex and 
anti-immobility effects of imipramine. The muscimol-induced current in the 
hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons and hippocampal expression of the 67-kDa 
isoform of glutamic acid decarboxylase significantly decreased in the Usp46 
mutant mice compared to control mice. All these phenotypes were rescued in 
transgenic mice with bacterial artificial chromosomes containing wild-type 
Usp46. Thus, Usp46 affects "behavioral despair" and it is implicated in the 
regulation of GABA action.

Rapid increase of Nurr1 mRNA expression in limbic and cortical brain structures 
related to coping with depression-like behavior in mice.

The immediate-early gene Nurr1 is a member of the inducible orphan nuclear 
receptor family. Nurr1 is essential to the differentiation, maturation, and 
maintenance of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and is expressed in different brain 
regions. We have reported that adult mice with reduced Nurr1 expression 
displayed an increase in immobility response to acute stress. These mice were 
also deficient in the retention of emotional memory. Thus, Nurr1 expression 
seems to be relevant to normal cognitive processes. To investigate the response 
of Nurr1 to a stress stimulus, Nurr1 mRNA expression was examined by in situ 
hybridization in adult mice using a depression-like behavior paradigm, the 
forced swim test. The Nurr1 gene was rapidly and widely up-regulated throughout 
the brain, including cortical areas (i.e., prefrontal cortex, primary and 
secondary visual cortex, primary auditory cortex, and secondary somatosensory 
cortex), hippocampus (dentate gyrus, CA1, CA2, and CA3), and midbrain 
(substantia nigra pars compacta and ventral tegmental area) at 30 min and 3 hr 
after the forced swim test. Dopamine content was reduced in prefrontal cortex 
and midbrain following swim stress. These results suggest that the increase in 
Nurr1 expression might be a compensatory mechanism to counteract the changes in 
forebrain dopamine transmission in coping with acute stress.

NPSR1 is a G protein coupled receptor expressed in multiple brain regions 
involved in modulation of stress. Central administration of NPS, the putative 
endogenous ligand of NPSR1, can induce hyperlocomotion, anxiolytic effects and 
activation of the HPA axis. The role of NPSR1 in the brain remains unsettled. 
Here we used NPSR1 gene-targeted mice to define the functional role of NPSR1 
under basal conditions on locomotion, anxiety- and/or depression-like behavior, 
corticosterone levels, acoustic startle with prepulse inhibition, learning and 
memory, and under NPS-induced locomotor activation, anxiolysis, and 
corticosterone release. Male, but not female, NPSR1-deficient mice exhibited 
enhanced depression-like behavior in a forced swim test, reduced acoustic 
startle response, and minor changes in the Morris water maze. Neither male nor 
female NPSR1-deficient mice showed alterations of baseline locomotion, 
anxiety-like behavior, or corticosterone release after exposure to a forced swim 
test or methamphetamine challenge in an open-field. After 
intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of NPS, NPSR1-deficient mice failed 
to show normal NPS-induced increases in locomotion, anxiolysis, or 
corticosterone release compared with WT NPS-treated mice. These findings 
demonstrate that NPSR1 is essential in mediating NPS effects on behavior.

The role of the opioid system in mediating effects of alcoholism and stress in 
depression is far from clear. We studied, therefore, the effects of chronic mild 
stress (CMS) and alcohol drinking on depression-like behavior and nociception in 
lines of mice selected for high (HA) or low (LA) swim stress-induced analgesia. 
Compared to the LA mice, the HA animals display up-regulation of opioid receptor 
system function and depression-like behavior in tail suspension test (TST). We 
report now that alcohol reverses depressive and pronociceptive effect of CMS in 
HA mice. In contrast, in LA mice CMS does not affect nociception or behavior in 
TST and the animals are not susceptible to alcohol under CMS. The results 
suggest that opioid system activity may determine the effects of alcohol on 
behavior under stress and, therefore, link predispositions to depression and to 
alcoholism.

Chronic stress enhances synaptic plasticity due to disinhibition in the anterior 
cingulate cortex and induces hyper-locomotion in mice.

The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is involved in the pathophysiology of a 
variety of mental disorders, many of which are exacerbated by stress. There are 
few studies, however, of stress-induced modification of synaptic function in the 
ACC that is relevant to emotional behavior. We investigated the effects of 
chronic restraint stress (CRS) on behavior and synaptic function in layers 
II/III of the ACC in mice. The duration of field excitatory postsynaptic 
potentials (fEPSPs) was longer in CRS mice than in control mice. The frequency 
of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) recorded by whole-cell 
patch-clamping was reduced in CRS mice, while miniature excitatory postsynaptic 
currents (mEPSCs) remained unchanged. Paired-pulse ratios (PPRs) of the fEPSP 
and evoked EPSC were larger in CRS. There was no difference in NMDA component of 
evoked EPSCs between the groups. Both long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term 
depression of fEPSP were larger in CRS mice than in control mice. The 
differences between the groups in fEPSP duration, PPRs and LTP level were not 
observed when the GABA(A) receptor was blocked by bicuculline. Compared to 
control mice, CRS mice exhibited hyper-locomotive activity in an open field 
test, while no difference was observed between the groups in anxiety-like 
behavior in a light/dark choice test. CRS mice displayed decreased freezing 
behavior in fear conditioning tests compared to control mice. These findings 
suggest that CRS facilitates synaptic plasticity in the ACC via increased 
excitability due to disinhibition of GABA(A) receptor signalling, which may 
underlie induction of behavioral hyper-locomotive activity after CRS.

Many studies with chronic stress, a common depression paradigm, lead to 
inconsistent behavioral results. We are introducing a new model of 
stress-induced anhedonia, which provides more reproducible induction and 
behavioral measuring of depressive-like phenotype in mice. First, a 4-week 
stress procedure induces anhedonia, defined by decreased sucrose preference, in 
the majority of but not all C57BL/6 mice. The remaining 30-50% non-anhedonic 
animals are used as an internal control for stress effects that are unrelated to 
anhedonia. Next, a modified sucrose test enables the detection of 
inter-individual differences in mice. Moreover, testing under dimmed lighting 
precludes behavioral artifacts caused by hyperlocomotion, a major confounding 
factor in stressed mice. Finally, moderation of the stress load increases the 
reproducibility of anhedonia induction, which otherwise is difficult to provide 
because of inter-batch variability in laboratory mice. We believe that our new 
mouse model overcomes some major difficulties in measuring behavior with chronic 
stress depression models.

Shaping brain development: mouse communal nesting blunts adult neuroendocrine 
and behavioral response to social stress and modifies chronic antidepressant 
treatment outcome.

Early experiences shape brain function and behavior and, consequently, 
vulnerability to psychopathology at adulthood. Here we exploited the mouse 
communal nest (CN) paradigm in order to investigate the effect of the early 
social environment on the emergence of endophenotypes of depression and on 
antidepressant efficacy at adulthood. CN, which consists in a single nest where 
three mothers keep their pups together and share care-giving behavior until 
weaning, is characterized by high levels of maternal behavior and peer 
interactions, thus representing an highly stimulating environment. Our results 
show that, when compared to mice reared in standard laboratory conditions (SN), 
adult CN mice exhibited greater sucrose preference on the first days of the 
test, displayed reduced anhedonia during social stress and had lower 
corticosterone levels after acute and prolonged social stress. Furthermore, in 
line with previous work, CN displayed longer immobility than SN mice in the 
forced swim test. Here we show that such behavioral response is differently 
affected by antidepressants according to early experiences. A 3-week fluoxetine 
treatment affected only SN mice, leading to an increase of immobility duration 
up to the levels showed by CN mice, while acute fluoxetine administration 
decreased immobility duration in both groups. These results show that being 
reared in a CN profoundly changes developmental trajectories, reducing the adult 
display of endophenotypes of depression and modifying response to 
antidepressants. The present findings suggest that early experiences represent 
one of those factors to be taken into account to identify the appropriate 
individual pharmacological strategy to treat depression in patients.

Peony glycosides produce antidepressant-like action in mice exposed to chronic 
unpredictable mild stress: effects on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function 
and brain-derived neurotrophic factor.

The root part of Paeonia lactiflora Pall. (Ranunculaceae), commonly known as 
peony, is a commonly used Chinese herb for the treatment of depression-like 
disorders. Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that total 
glycosides of peony (TGP) produced antidepressant-like action in various mouse 
models of behavioral despair. The present study aimed to examine whether TGP 
could affect the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression in 
mice. The mechanism(s) underlying the antidepressant-like action was 
investigated by measuring serum corticosterone level, glucocorticoid receptor 
(GR) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA levels in brain tissues. 
CUMS, being lasted for 6 weeks, caused depression-like behavior in mice, as 
indicated by the significant decrease in sucrose consumption and increase in 
immobility time in the forced swim test. Whereas serum corticosterone level was 
significantly increased in mice exposed to CUMS, expressions of GR mRNA in 
hippocampus, and BDNF mRNA in hippocampus and frontal cortex, were decreased in 
CUMS-treated mice. Daily intragastric administration of TGP (80 or 160 
mg/kg/day) during the six weeks of CUMS significantly suppressed behavioral and 
biochemical changes induced by CUMS. The results suggest that the 
antidepressant-like action of TPG is likely mediated by modulating the function 
of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and increasing the expression of BDNF in 
brain tissues.

The detailed mechanisms of emotional modulation in the nervous system by opioids 
remain to be elucidated, although the opioid system is well known to play 
important roles in the mechanisms of analgesia and drug dependence. In the 
present study, we conducted behavioral tests of anxiety and depression and 
measured corticosterone concentrations in both male and female mu-opioid 
receptor knockout (MOP-KO) mice to reveal the involvement of mu-opioid receptors 
in stress-induced emotional responses. MOP-KO mice entered more and spent more 
time in the open arms of the elevated plus maze compared with wild-type mice. 
MOP-KO mice also displayed significantly decreased immobility in a 15 min 
tail-suspension test compared with wild-type mice. Similarly, MOP-KO mice 
exhibited significantly decreased immobility on days 2, 3, and 4 in a 6 min 
forced swim test conducted for 5 consecutive days. The increase in plasma 
corticosterone concentration induced by tail-suspension, repeated forced swim, 
or restraint stress was reduced in MOP-KO mice compared with wild-type mice. 
Corticosterone levels were not different between wild-type and MOP-KO mice 
before stress exposure. In contrast, although female mice tended to exhibit 
fewer anxiety-like responses in the tail-suspension test in both genotypes, no 
significant gender differences were observed in stress-induced emotional 
responses. These results suggest that MOPs play an important facilitatory role 
in emotional responses to stress, including anxiety- and depression-like 
behavior and corticosterone levels.

Several studies investigated the effect of physical exercise on emotional 
behaviors in rodents; resulting findings however remain controversial. Despite 
the accepted notion that voluntary exercise alters behavior in the same manners 
as antidepressant drugs, several studies reported opposite or no effects at all. 
In an attempt to evaluate the effect of physical exercise on emotional behaviors 
and brain plasticity, we individually housed C57BL/6J male mice in cages 
equipped with a running wheel. Three weeks after continuous voluntary running we 
assessed their anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. Tests included openfield, 
dark-light-box, elevated O-maze, learned helplessness, and forced swim test. We 
measured corticosterone metabolite levels in feces collected over a 24-h period 
and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in several brain regions. 
Furthermore, cell proliferation and adult hippocampal neurogenesis were assessed 
using Ki67 and Doublecortin. Voluntary wheel running induced increased anxiety 
in the openfield, elevated O-maze, and dark-light-box and higher levels of 
excreted corticosterone metabolites. We did not observe any antidepressant 
effect of running despite a significant increase of hippocampal neurogenesis and 
BDNF. These data are thus far the first to indicate that the effect of physical 
exercise in mice may be ambiguous. On one hand, the running-induced increase of 
neurogenesis and BDNF seems to be irrelevant in tests for depression-like 
behavior, at least in the present model where running activity exceeded previous 
reports. On the other hand, exercising mice display a more anxious phenotype and 
are exposed to higher levels of stress hormones such as corticosterone. 
Intriguingly, numbers of differentiating neurons correlate significantly with 
anxiety parameters in the openfield and dark-light-box. We therefore conclude 
that adult hippocampal neurogenesis is a crucial player in the genesis of 
anxiety.

No animal models replicate the complexity of human depression. However, a number 
of behavioral tests in rodents are sensitive to antidepressants and may thus tap 
important underlying biological factors. Such models may also offer the best 
opportunity to discover novel treatments. Here, we used several of these models 
to test the hypothesis that the acid-sensing ion channel-1a (ASIC1a) might be 
targeted to reduce depression. Genetically disrupting ASIC1a in mice produced 
antidepressant-like effects in the forced swim test, the tail suspension test, 
and following unpredictable mild stress. Pharmacologically inhibiting ASIC1a 
also had antidepressant-like effects in the forced swim test. The effects of 
ASIC1a disruption in the forced swim test were independent of and additive to 
those of several commonly used antidepressants. Furthermore, ASIC1a disruption 
interfered with an important biochemical marker of depression, the ability of 
stress to reduce BDNF in the hippocampus. Restoring ASIC1a to the amygdala of 
ASIC1a(-/-) mice with a viral vector reversed the forced swim test effects, 
suggesting that the amygdala is a key site of ASIC1a action in 
depression-related behavior. These data are consistent with clinical studies 
emphasizing the importance of the amygdala in mood regulation, and suggest that 
ASIC1a antagonists may effectively combat depression.

hepatoma-bearing mice.

The high incidence of depression among cancer patients has created the need for 
deeper insights into its underlying pathophysiological mechanism. The aim of the 
current study is to demonstrate the presence of depressive states due to 
allostatic tumor-burden in the animal model, and if possible to elucidate the 
mechanism(s) by which the tumor might induce the depressive state. 
Stress-related behavioral responses and tumor weight were evaluated 6, 8, and 12 
days after implantation of H22 hepatoma cells into the right flank of mice. 
Brain changes associated with depression were also observed 12 days after tumor 
implantation. The mice that were subjected to tumor-burden exhibited a 
significant depression-like state which manifested as behavioral changes 
including prolonged time spent immobile in the tail suspension test and reduced 
spontaneous motor activity with tumor progression. These behavior indices 
changed significantly 12 days after tumor implantation and were improved by the 
antidepressant fluoxetine. Correspondingly, the activity of superoxide dismutase 
(SOD) in the cerebrum and the expression of glia maturation factor beta 
(GMF-beta) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus were 
significantly decreased in tumor-bearing mice, and these decreases were also 
reversed by fluoxetine. Taken together, these data indicate that tumor-burden 
might induce depressive-related behavior and brain changes, and suggest that 
antidepressants might not only palliate depression symptoms but also modify 
disease processes in the auxiliary treatment of cancer.

BACKGROUND: The molecular mechanisms of stress-induced depressive behaviors have 
been characterized extensively in male rodents; however, much less is known 
about female subjects, despite the fact that human depression is far more 
prevalent in women.
METHODS: To gain insight into these mechanisms, we performed microarray analysis 
in nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain reward region implicated in depression, 
in ovariectomized (OVX) and gonadally intact female mice after chronic 
unpredictable stress and measured stress-induced depression-like behavior in the 
forced swim test (FST). Male mice were studied in the FST for comparison.
RESULTS: We find that stress regulation of genes in NAc of gonadally intact 
female mice is blunted in OVX mice. This pattern of gene regulation is 
consistent with behavioral findings on the FST: the pro-depression-like effect 
of stress in intact female mice is absent in OVX female and gonadally intact 
male mice. We identified, among many genes regulated by stress, several nuclear 
factor kappaB (NFkappaB) subunits-a pro-survival transcription factor involved 
in cellular responses to stress-as being highly upregulated in NAc of OVX mice. 
Given the role of NFkappaB during stress, we hypothesized that upregulation of 
NFkappaB by OVX decreases susceptibility to stress. Indeed, we show that 
inhibition of NFkappaB in NAc of OVX animals increases susceptibility to 
stress-induced depressive behaviors, whereas activation of NFkappaB in NAc of 
intact female subjects blocks susceptibility.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a hormonal mechanism of NFkappaB regulation 
that contributes to stress-induced depressive behaviors in female subjects and 
might represent a mechanism for gender differences in prevalence rates of these 
disorders in humans.

Smokers often report an anxiolytic effect of cigarettes. In addition, 
stress-related disorders such as anxiety, post-traumatic stress syndrome and 
depression are often associated with chronic nicotine use. To study the role of 
the alpha5 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit in anxiety-related 
responses, control and alpha5 subunit null mice (alpha5(-/-)) were subjected to 
the open field activity (OFA), light-dark box (LDB) and elevated plus maze (EPM) 
tests. In the OFA and LDB, alpha5(-/-) behaved like wild-type controls. In the 
EPM, female alpha5(-/-) mice displayed an anxiolytic-like phenotype, while male 
alpha5(-/-) mice were undistinguishable from littermate controls. We studied the 
hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis by measuring plasma corticosterone and 
hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing factor. Consistent with an anxiolytic-like 
phenotype, female alpha5(-/-) mice displayed lower basal corticosterone levels. 
To test whether gonadal steroids regulate the expression of alpha5, we treated 
cultured NTera 2 cells with progesterone and found that alpha5 protein levels 
were upregulated. In addition, brain levels of alpha5 mRNA increased upon 
progesterone injection into ovariectomized wild-type females. Finally, we tested 
anxiety levels in the EPM during the estrous cycle. The estrus phase (when 
progesterone levels are low) is anxiolytic-like in wild-type mice, but no 
cycle-dependent fluctuations in anxiety levels were found in alpha5(-/-) 
females. Thus, alpha5-containing neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors may 
be mediators of anxiogenic responses, and progesterone-dependent modulation of 
alpha5 expression may contribute to fluctuations in anxiety levels during the 
ovarian cycle.

A tight regulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity is 
essential for successful adaptation to stressful stimuli. Disruption of normal 
HPA axis development is a main risk factor for diseases such as posttraumatic 
stress disorder or depression, but the molecular mechanisms that lead to these 
long-term consequences are poorly understood. Here, we test the hypothesis that 
the pituitary glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is involved in regulating HPA axis 
function in neonatal and adult animals. Furthermore, we investigate whether 
postnatal hypercortisolism induced by pituitary GR deficiency is a main factor 
contributing to the persistent effects of early-life stress. Conditional 
knockout mice with a deletion of the GR at the pituitary (GR(POMCCre)) show 
excessive basal corticosterone levels during postnatal development, but not in 
adulthood. The hypercortisolemic state of neonatal GR(POMCCre) mice is 
accompanied by central gene expression changes of CRH and vasopressin in the 
paraventricular nucleus, but these alterations normalize at later ages. In adult 
mice, pituitary GR deficiency results in impaired glucocorticoid negative 
feedback. Furthermore, adult GR(POMCCre) mice display a more active coping 
strategy in the forced swim test, with no alterations in anxiety like behavior 
or cognitive functions. Postnatal GR antagonist treatment is able to prevent the 
long-term behavioral effects in GR(POMCCre) mice. In conclusion, we show that 
pituitary GRs are centrally involved in regulating HPA axis activity in neonates 
and mediate negative feedback regulation in adult animals. Postnatal 
glucocorticoid excess results in an altered stress-coping behavior in adult 
animals, with no effects on anxiety like behavior or cognition.

There is growing evidence that neuropeptide Y (NPY) acting through Y1 and Y2 
receptors has a prominent role in modulating anxiety- and depression-like 
behavior in rodents. However, a role of other Y-receptors like that of Y4 
receptors in this process is poorly understood. We now investigated male Y2, Y4 
single and Y2/Y4 double knockout mice in behavioral paradigms for changes in 
motor activity, anxiety and depression-like behavior. Motor activity was 
increased in Y2, Y4 and Y2/Y4 knockout mice under changing and stressful 
conditions, but not altered in a familiar environment. Y4 and Y2 knockout mice 
revealed an anxiolytic phenotype in the light/dark test, marble burying test and 
in stress-induced hyperthermia, and reduced depression-like behavior in the 
forced swim and tail suspension tests. In Y2/Y4 double knockout mice, the 
response in the light/dark test and in the forced swim test was further enhanced 
compared with Y4 and Y2 knockout mice, respectively. High levels of Y4 binding 
sites were observed in brain stem nuclei including nucleus of solitary tract and 
area postrema. Lower levels were found in the medial amygdala and hypothalamus. 
Peripheral administration of pancreatic polypeptide (PP) induced Y4 
receptor-dependent c-Fos expression in brain stem, hypothalamus and amygdala. PP 
released peripherally from the pancreas in response to food intake, may act not 
only as a satiety signal but also modulate anxiety-related locomotion.

Growth factors in the brain are important to depression and it's treatment and 
we assessed the ability of peripherally administered insulin-like growth 
factor-I (IGF-I) to influence behavior related to depression. We found that mice 
that received chronic IGF-I treatment showed antidepressant-like behavior in 
forced-swim and novelty-induced hypophagia (NIH) tests and increased sucrose 
consumption after chronic mild unpredictable stress exposure. Additionally, 
peripheral anti-IGF-I administration blocked exercise-induced antidepressant 
effects in the forced-swim test (FST). These results support the functional 
relevance of neurotrophic mechanisms to depression and extend this idea to 
include neurotrophic factors in the periphery.

Prodynorphin-derived peptides are critical modulators of anxiety and regulate 
neurochemistry and corticosterone.

Stress and anxiety are mainly regulated by amygdala and hypothalamic circuitries 
involving several neurotransmitter systems and providing physiological responses 
to peripheral organs via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and other 
pathways. The role of endogenous opioid peptides in this process is largely 
unknown. Here we show for the first time that anxiolytic parameters of 
explorative behavior in mice lacking prodynorphin were increased 2-4-fold in the 
open field, the elevated plus maze and the light-dark test. Consistent with 
this, treatment of wild-type mice with selective kappa-opioid receptor 
antagonists GNTI or norbinaltorphimine showed the same effects. Furthermore, 
treatment of prodynorphin knockout animals with U-50488H, a selective 
kappa-opioid receptor agonist, fully reversed their anxiolytic phenotype. These 
behavioral data are supported by an approximal 30% reduction in 
corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) mRNA expression in the hypothalamic 
paraventricular nucleus and central amygdala and an accompanying 30-40% decrease 
in corticosterone serum levels in prodynorphin knockout mice. Although 
stress-induced increases in corticosterone levels were attenuated in 
prodynorphin knockout mice, they were associated with minor increases in 
depression-like behavior in the tail suspension and forced swim tests. Taken 
together, our data suggest a pronounced impact of endogenous 
prodynorphin-derived peptides on anxiety, but not stress coping ability and that 
these effects are mediated via kappa-opioid receptors. The delay in the 
behavioral response to kappa-opioid receptor agonists and antagonist treatment 
suggests an indirect control level for the action of dynorphin, probably by 
modulating the expression of CRH or neuropeptide Y, and subsequently influencing 
behavior.

Chronic corticosterone and isolation rearing paradigms may provide reliable 
mouse models of depression. Using these models, the present study examined if 
the specific glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, RU-43044, has an 
antidepressant-like effect, and studied the possible role of prefrontal 
neurotransmission on the behavioral effects. Chronic administration of 
corticosterone and isolation rearing increased the immobility time in the forced 
swim and tail suspension tests. Subchronic treatment with RU-43044 decreased the 
immobility time in the forced swim test in chronic corticosterone-treated and 
isolation-reared mice, but not the control mice. Chronic corticosterone 
decreased the levels of cortical glucocorticoid receptors and stress-induced 
increases in plasma corticosterone levels, and blocked the response of plasma 
corticosterone to dexamethasone, while isolation rearing did not cause any 
changes in the glucocorticoid receptor system. Both chronic corticosterone and 
isolation rearing markedly increased high K+ -induced dopamine release, but not 
serotonin release, in the prefrontal cortex. Subchronic RU-43044 reversed the 
enhanced release of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex of chronic 
corticosterone-treated and isolation-reared mice. These results suggest that 
chronic corticosterone and isolation rearing increase the depressive-like 
behavior in glucocorticoid receptor-dependent and independent manners, 
respectively, and that RU-43044 shows an antidepressant-like effect, probably 
via an inhibition of enhanced prefrontal dopaminergic neurotransmission in these 
mouse models.

Etiopathogenesis of depression and the cause of insensitivity to treatment 
remain poorly understood, although genetic makeup has been established as a 
contributing factor. The isogenicity of inbred mouse strains provides a useful 
tool for investigating the link between genes and behavior or drug response. 
Hence, our aim was to identify inbred mouse strains (among A/J, BALB/c, C3H, 
C57BL/6, CBA, DBA and FVB) sensitive to a 9-week period of unpredictable chronic 
mild stress (UCMS) and, from the fifth week onward, to the reversal effect of an 
antidepressant (AD) (imipramine, 20mg/kg/day i.p.) on various depression-related 
changes: physical, behavioral and neuroendocrine states. UCMS induced a 
significant deterioration of the coat state (in all the strains), blunted 
emotional reactivity in the novelty-suppressed feeding (NSF) test (A/J, BALB/c, 
C57BL/6), and changes in the level of fecal corticosterone metabolites (BALB/c, 
C57BL/6, DBA, FVB). Imipramine treatment reversed the UCMS-induced alterations 
of the coat state (BALB/c, DBA), in the NSF test (A/J, BALB/c, C57BL/6) and in 
fecal corticosterone metabolites (BALB/c, C57BL/6). C3H, CBA and FVB mice were 
irresponsive to imipramine treatment. It is noteworthy that UCMS-induced 
physical or behavioral changes occurred without hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal 
(HPA) axis alterations in some strains (A/J, C3H, CBA), although the AD-induced 
reversal of these changes in BALB/c and C57BL/6 was associated with HPA axis 
normalization. Finally, UCMS is shown to discriminate various alterations and to 
replicate in a strain-dependent manner diverse profiles reminiscent of human 
disease subtypes. UCMS may thus enable the selection of strains suitable for 
investigating specific depression-related features and could be an appropriate 
model for identifying genetic factors associated with increased vulnerability, 
specific symptoms of affective disorders, and AD resistance.

Acute hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor restores motivational and 
forced swim performance after corticosterone.

BACKGROUND: Alterations in cellular survival and plasticity are implicated in 
the neurobiology of depression, based primarily on the characterization of 
antidepressant efficacy in naïve rodents rather than on models that capture the 
debilitating and protracted feelings of anhedonia and loss of motivation that 
are core features of depression.
METHODS: In adult male mice, we evaluated persistent effects of oral 
corticosterone (CORT) exposure on anhedonic-like behavior, immobility in the 
forced swim test (FST), motivational performance in the progressive ratio task, 
and later endogenous CORT secretion. After verifying long-term decreases in 
hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and cAMP Response Element 
Binding protein phosphorylation (pCREB), the ability of direct hippocampal BDNF 
microinfusion after CORT exposure to reverse deficits was investigated.
RESULTS: Prior CORT exposure decreased sucrose consumption, appetitive 
responding, and FST mobility without long-term effects on water/quinine 
discrimination and endogenous CORT secretion. Critically, BDNF replacement 
mimicked chronic antidepressant treatment (ADT) by reversing CORT-induced 
reductions in instrumental performance and FST mobility.
CONCLUSIONS: Together these findings link persistent alterations in hippocampal 
BDNF expression and CREB transcriptional activity with a persistent 
depressive-like state-as opposed to ADT efficacy. These results identify 
hippocampal BDNF as an essential molecular substrate that bidirectionally 
regulates appetitive instrumental behavior. Additionally, we suggest this CORT 
model might provide a powerful tool for future investigation into the 
neurobiology of complex stress-associated depressive symptoms that persist long 
after stress exposure itself.

The behavioral and hematological effects of treatment with Chamomilla 6cH in 
mice subjected to experimental stress are described. Swiss mice were randomly 
divided into pairs, one animal was inoculated with Ehrlich's tumor, the other 
was treated daily with Chamomilla 6cH or control or received no treatment. After 
7 days, the animals were observed in an open-field arena and blood samples 
taken. Mice who cohabitated with a sick cage-mate showed a decrease in their 
general activity, but those treated with Chamomilla 6cH were less severely 
affected (p=0.0426). No hematological changes were observed. In a second 
experiment, the forced swimming test was applied to mice pre-treated with 
Chamomilla 6cH, controls were: water, 10% ethanol or amitriptyline. Only the 
amitriptyline and ethanol treated groups showed significant excitatory behavior 
(p=0.0020), Chamomilla 6cH treated animals' scores intermediate between water 
control and ethanol or amitriptyline. A decrease in the leukocyte count was 
observed in the amitriptyline and Chamomilla 6cH treated groups (p=0.039). These 
data suggest that treatment with Chamomilla 6cH is related to the recovery of 
basal behavioral conditions in mice subjected to stressful conditions.

antidepressant-like action of tramadol in the unpredictable chronic mild stress 
in mice.

RATIONALE: Tramadol is a centrally acting clinically effective analgesic, with a 
weak opioid receptor affinity. It shows antidepressant-like effects in animal 
models such as forced swimming test, learned helplessness, and unpredictable 
chronic mild stress (UCMS) and enhances the concentrations of noradrenaline (NA) 
and serotonin (5-HT) by interfering with their reuptake and release mechanisms, 
like some antidepressants.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore whether the antidepressant-like 
effects of tramadol is affected by the serotonergic system. For this purpose, 
the effects of a lesion of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) by 
5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) on the action of tramadol (20 mg/kg, i.p.) on 
depression-related behavior and neurochemical correlates were investigated in 
mice. From the third week onward, we administered tramadol chronically during 4 
weeks.
RESULTS: Tramadol reversed the physical and behavioral abnormalities induced by 
the UCMS. Furthermore, the lesion of the DRN by 5,7-DHT antagonized the 
antidepressant-like effects of tramadol on the coat state, in the splash test 
but not in the resident-intruder test. The results obtained by high-pressure 
liquid chromatography showed that the level of 5-HT was reduced by the lesion in 
some brain regions without affecting the level of NA. Moreover, while the UCMS 
regimen diminished the level of 5-HT, tramadol increased the level of this 
neurotransmitter in certain regions.
CONCLUSIONS: These results seem to indicate that the serotonergic system is 
critically involved in the antidepressant-like effects of tramadol in the UCMS 
in mice.

RATIONALE: Serotonin (5-HT)(2C) receptors are implicated in the control of mood, 
and their blockade is of potential interest for the management of 
anxiodepressive states.
OBJECTIVES: Herein, we characterized the in vitro and in vivo pharmacological 
profile of the novel benzourea derivative, S32006.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Standard cellular, electrophysiological, neurochemical, 
and behavioral procedures were used.
RESULTS: S32006 displayed high affinity for human (h)5-HT(2C) and h5-HT(2B) 
receptors (pK (i)s, 8.4 and 8.0, respectively). By contrast, it had negligible 
(100-fold lower) affinity for h5-HT(2A) receptors and all other sites examined. 
In measures of Gq-protein coupling/phospholipase C activation, S32006 displayed 
potent antagonist properties at h5-HT(2C) receptors (pK (B) values, 8.8/8.2) and 
h5-HT(2B) receptors (7.8/7.7). In vivo, S32006 dose-dependently (2.5-40.0 mg/kg, 
i.p. and p.o.) abolished the induction of penile erections and a discriminative 
stimulus by the 5-HT(2C) receptor agonist, Ro60,0175, in rats. It elevated 
dialysis levels of noradrenaline and dopamine in the frontal cortex of freely 
moving rats, and accelerated the firing rate of ventrotegmental dopaminergic and 
locus ceruleus adrenergic neurons. At similar doses, S32006 decreased immobility 
in a forced-swim test in rats, reduced the motor depression elicited by 5-HT(2C) 
and alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonists, and inhibited both aggressive and 
marble-burying behavior in mice. Supporting antidepressant properties, chronic 
(2-5 weeks) administration of S32006 suppressed "anhedonia" in a chronic mild 
stress procedure and increased both expression of BDNF and cell proliferation in 
rat dentate gyrus. Finally, S32006 (0.63-40 mg/kg, i.p. and p.o) displayed 
anxiolytic properties in Vogel conflict and social interaction tests in rats.
CONCLUSION: S32006 is a potent 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonist, and possesses 
antidepressant and anxiolytic properties in diverse rodent models.

Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is involved in the regulation of emotional behavior, and 
there is indirect evidence for a role of NPY in the cerebral responses to 
peripheral immune challenge. Since the NPY receptors involved in these reactions 
are not known, we investigated the effect of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS) on emotional, locomotor and social behavior, body temperature and 
circulating corticosterone in female Y2 (Y2-/-) and Y4 (Y4-/-) receptor knockout 
mice. LPS (0.1mg/kg injected IP 2.5h before testing) increased rectal 
temperature in control and Y4-/- mice to a larger degree than in Y2-/- animals. 
Both Y2-/- and Y4-/- mice exhibited reduced anxiety-related and depression-like 
behavior in the open field, elevated plus-maze and tail suspension test, 
respectively. While depression-like behavior was not changed by LPS, 
anxiety-related behavior was enhanced by LPS in Y2-/-, but not control and Y4-/- 
animals. Y2-/- mice were also particularly susceptible to the effect of LPS to 
attenuate locomotor behavior and social interaction with another mouse. The 
corticosterone response to LPS was blunted in Y2-/- mice which presented 
elevated levels of circulating corticosterone following vehicle treatment. These 
data show that Y2-/- mice are particularly sensitive to the effects of 
LPS-evoked immune stress to attenuate locomotion and social interaction and to 
increase anxiety-like behavior, while the LPS-induced rise of temperature and 
circulating corticosterone is suppressed by Y2 receptor knockout. Our 
observations attest to an important role of endogenous NPY acting via Y2 
receptors in the cerebral response to peripheral immune challenge.

Affective disorders such as major depression are among the most prevalent and

still poorly understood. In recent years, it has become evident that alterations 
of the stress hormone system, in particular dysfunctions (hyper- or 
hypo-activity) of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, play a 
prominent role in the development of major depressive disorders. Therefore, we 
aimed to generate a new animal model comprising these neuroendocrine core 
symptoms in order to unravel parameters underlying increased or decreased stress 
reactivity. Starting from a population of outbred mice (parental generation: 100 
males and 100 females of the CD-1 strain), two breeding lines were established 
according to the outcome of a 'stress reactivity test' (SRT), consisting of a 
15-min restraint period and tail blood samplings immediately before and after 
exposure to the stressor. Mice showing a very high or a very low secretion of 
corticosterone in the SRT, i.e. animals expressing a hyper- or a hypo-reactivity 
of the HPA axis, were selected for the 'high reactivity' (HR) and the 'low 
reactivity' (LR) breeding line, respectively. Additionally, a third breeding 
line was established consisting of animals with an 'intermediate reactivity' 
(IR) in the SRT. Already in the first generation, i.e. animals derived from 
breeding pairs selected from the parental generation, significant differences in 
the reactivity of the HPA axis between HR, IR, and LR mice were observed. 
Moreover, these differences were found across all subsequent generations and 
could be increased by selective breeding, which indicates a genetic basis of the 
respective phenotype. Repeated testing of individuals in the SRT furthermore 
proved that the observed differences in stress responsiveness are present 
already early in life and can be regarded as a robust genetic predisposition. 
Tests investigating the animal's emotionality including anxiety-related 
behavior, exploratory drive, locomotor activity, and depression-like behavior 
point to phenotypic similarities with behavioral changes observed in depressive 
patients. In general, HR males and females were 'hyperactive' in some behavioral 
paradigms, resembling symptoms of restlessness and agitation often seen in 
melancholic depression. LR mice, on the other hand, showed more 
passive-aggressive coping styles, corresponding to signs of retardation and 
retreat observed in atypical depression. Several morphometric and neuroendocrine 
findings further support this view. For example, monitoring the circadian rhythm 
of glucocorticoid secretion revealed clearly increased trough levels in HR mice, 
resulting in a flattened diurnal rhythm, again adding to the neuroendocrine 
similarities to patients suffering from melancholic depression. Taken together, 
our results suggest that distinct mechanisms influencing the function and 
regulation of the HPA axis are involved in the respective behavioral and 
neurobiological endophenotypes. Thus, the generated HR/IR/LR mouse lines can be 
a valuable model to elucidate molecular genetic, neuroendocrine, and behavioral 
parameters associated with altered stress reactivity, thereby improving our 
understanding of affective disorders, presumably including the symptomatology 
and pathophysiology of specific subtypes of major depression.

The present study was made to investigate the role of tachykinin NK2 receptors 
in the expression of stress-related behaviors in animals. Under basal 
conditions, intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of the selective tachykinin 
NK2 receptor antagonist, saredutant (1 and 3 mg/kg) or diazepam (1 mg/kg) 
exerted anxiolytic-like effects in rodents, as they reduced grooming score of 
Wistar male rats tested in the novelty-induced grooming sampling test (NGT) and 
increased percentage of time and entries in open arms of Swiss male mice tested 
in the elevated plus maze (EPM) test. After previous exposure to stress-related 
conditions, as induced by a 2-min forced swim made 5 min prior to the EPM test, 
saredutant but not diazepam, exhibited anxiolytic-like effects in mice. To study 
the antidepressant-like activity of tachykinin NK2 receptor antagonist under 
basal conditions, different groups of rats were injected i.p. with saredutant 
(2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg) or the tricyclic antidepressant, clomipramine (50 mg/kg) 
and tested in the forced swim test (FST), a widely used 
antidepressant-responsive test. The influence of stress-related conditions was 
studied in rats subjected to electric foot-shocks (1 mA, 1 s) 24, 5 and 1 h 
prior to FST, after drugs injection. In the FST, clomipramine decreased the 
immobility time only under basal conditions, but not after application of acute 
foot-shocks. To the contrary, saredutant-treated rats also exhibited more active 
behavior in FST after previous exposure to stressors. These results give further 
support to the hypothesis that tachykinin NK2 receptors may be a therapeutic 
target for pharmacological treatment of stress-related diseases, such as anxiety 
and depression.

RATIONALE: Many studies support the validity of the chronic mild stress (CMS) 
model of depression in rodents. However, most of them focus on analysis of 
reactivity to rewards during the CMS and/or depressive-like behavior shortly 
after stress. In this study, we investigate acute and long-term effects of CMS 
and antidepressant treatment on depressive, anxiety-like behavior and learning.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice (C57BL/6) were exposed to CMS for 6 weeks and 
anhedonia was evaluated by weekly monitoring of sucrose intake. Paroxetine (10 
mg kg(-1)day(-1) i.p.) or saline were administered the last 3 weeks of CMS and 
continued for 2 weeks thereafter. Behavioral tests were performed over the last 
week of CMS (acute effects) and 1 month later (long-term effects).
RESULTS: Mice exposed to CMS displayed both acute and long-term decreased 
sucrose intake, increased immobility in the forced swimming test (FST) and 
impaired memory in the novel object recognition test. It is interesting to note 
that a correlation was found between the cognitive deficits and the helpless 
behavior in the FST induced by CMS. During the CMS procedure, paroxetine 
treatment reverted partially recognition memory impairment but failed to prevent 
the increased immobility in the FST. Moreover, it decreased on its own sucrose 
intake. Importantly, the long-term effects of CMS were partially prevented by 
chronic paroxetine.
CONCLUSIONS: CMS leads to a long-term altered behavioral profile that could be 
partially reverted by chronic antidepressant treatment. This study brings novel 
features regarding the long-term effects of CMS and on the predictive validity 
of this depression animal model.

Disruption of the circadian output molecule prokineticin 2 results in anxiolytic 
and antidepressant-like effects in mice.

Disrupted circadian rhythms are strictly associated with mood disorders. The 
suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the master pacemaker that drives circadian 
rhythms in mammals. However, the underlying molecular connections of circadian 
rhythm and mood disorders are still poorly understood. Prokineticin 2 (PK2) is a 
signaling molecule that is critical for transmitting the circadian rhythms from 
the SCN. Previously, it is has been shown that the receptor for PK2 is expressed 
in virtually all of the primary SCN target areas, most of which are also 
involved in the mood regulation. In the current study, we investigated the role 
of PK2 in the regulation of anxiety and depression-related behaviors. 
Intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion of PK2 increased anxiety-like behavior as 
assessed by light-dark box. ICV delivery of PK2 also led to increased 
depression-like behavior in the forced swimming test. Conversely, mice lacking 
the PK2 gene (PK2(-/-) mice) displayed significantly reduced anxiety and 
depression-like behaviors. Furthermore, PK2(-/-) mice showed impaired responses 
to new environments in terms of locomotor activity, arousal, body temperature, 
and food intake. Our studies, thus, indicate that PK2 signaling plays a critical 
role in the stress-related traits in mice, and establish a possible molecular 
link between circadian rhythms and mood regulation.

postnatal development: evidence from sleep, stress, and behavior.

Dysfunction of the serotonin system is implicated in sleep and emotional 
disorders. To test whether these impairments could arise during development, we 
studied the impact of early-life, transient versus genetic, permanent 
alterations of serotonin reuptake on sleep-wakefulness patterns, 
depression-related behavior, and associated physiological features. Here, we 
show that female mice treated neonatally with a highly selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitor, escitalopram, exhibited signs of depression in the form of 
sleep anomalies, anhedonia, increased helplessness reversed by chronic 
antidepressant treatment, enhanced response to acute stress, and increased 
serotoninergic autoinhibitory feedback. This syndrome was not reproduced by 
treatment in naive adults but resembled the phenotype of mutant mice lacking the 
serotonin transporter, except that these exhibited decreased serotonin 
autoreceptor sensitivity and additional anxiety-like behavior. Thus, alteration 
of serotonin reuptake during development, whether induced by external or genetic 
factors, causes a depressive syndrome lasting into adulthood. Such early-life 
impairments might predispose individuals to sleep and/or mood disorders.

Antidepressant-like effects of the CRF family peptides, urocortin 1, urocortin 2 
and urocortin 3 in a modified forced swimming test in mice.

Most of the evidence suggests that corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is 
involved in mood disorders. The CRF receptors type 1 (CRF(1) receptors) elicit a 
stress response, and their natural and synthetic antagonists have been studied 
as possible drugs against depression, whereas CRF receptors type 2 (CRF(2) 
receptors) appear to alleviate the stress response and mediate anxiolytic 
action. Other CRF family peptides are urocortin 1 (Ucn 1), urocortin 2 (Ucn 2) 
and urocortin 3 (Ucn 3). Little is known about the action of Ucn 1, Ucn 2 and 
Ucn 3 on depressive disorders. Antidepressant-like effects of Ucn 1, Ucn 2 and 
Ucn 3 (0.13, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/2 microl, i.c.v.) were assayed in mice in a 
modified forced swimming test (FST). This modified FST predicts the clinical 
efficacy of an antidepressant drug through the scoring of immobility, climbing 
and swimming behavior. The study demonstrated that Ucn 1 had no action on any of 
parameters studied in the modified FST. Ucn 2 elicited antidepressive-like 
action by shortening the immobility time. Additionally Ucn 2 significantly 
increased the climbing and swimming times. Ucn 3 likewise displayed an 
antidepressive-like effect by shortening the immobility time, and increasing the 
climbing and swimming times. The results suggest that CRF(2) receptor 
stimulation by Ucn 2 or Ucn 3 leads to antidepressant-like action, but dual 
stimulation of the CRF(1) and CRF(2) receptors by Ucn 1 does not trigger 
antidepressant-like action in the modified mouse FST.

Neuropeptide Y (NPY) acting through Y1 receptors reduces anxiety- and 
depression-like behavior in rodents, whereas Y2 receptor stimulation has the 
opposite effect. This study addressed the implication of Y4 receptors in 
emotional behavior by comparing female germ line Y4 knockout (Y4-/-) mice with 
control and germ line Y2-/- animals. Anxiety- and depression-like behavior was 
assessed with the open field (OF), elevated plus maze (EPM), stress-induced 
hyperthermia (SIH) and tail suspension tests (TST), respectively. Learning and 
memory were evaluated with the object recognition test (ORT). In the OF and EPM, 
both Y4-/- and Y2-/- mice exhibited reduced anxiety-related behavior and 
enhanced locomotor activity relative to control animals. Locomotor activity in a 
familiar environment was unchanged in Y4-/- but reduced in Y2-/- mice. The basal 
rectal temperature exhibited diurnal and genotype-related alterations. Control 
mice had temperature minima at noon and midnight, whereas Y4-/- and Y2-/- mice 
displayed only one temperature minimum at noon. The magnitude of SIH was related 
to time of the day and genotype in a complex manner. In the TST, the duration of 
immobility was significantly shorter in Y4-/- and Y2-/- mice than in controls. 
Object memory 6 h after initial exposure to the ORT was impaired in Y2-/- but 
not in Y4-/- mice, relative to control mice. These results show that genetic 
deletion of Y4 receptors, like that of Y2 receptors, reduces anxiety-like and 
depression-related behavior. Unlike Y2 receptor knockout, Y4 receptor knockout 
does not impair object memory. We propose that Y4 receptors play an important 
role in the regulation of behavioral homeostasis.

Previous studies have demonstrated that kappa opioid receptor (KOR) antagonists 
reduce stress- and depression-like behaviors. We hypothesized that 
administration of a novel opioid mixed agonist/antagonist capable of antagonist 
activity at the KOR would attenuate forced-swim stress (FSS)-induced immobility, 
an animal model of depression-like behavior. C57Bl/6J mice were exposed to 
antinociceptive and repeated FSS testing after pretreatment with a graded dose 
of a novel bivalent morphinan compound, bis(N-cyclobutylmethylmorphinan-3-yl) 
sebacoylate dihydrochloride (MCL-144B). MCL-144B demonstrated dose- and 
time-dependent antinociception and KOR-mediated antagonism. In support of the 
hypothesis, pretreatment with MCL-144B dose-dependently attenuated 
stress-induced antinociception and immobility in the forced-swim test.

There is a gender-related comorbidity of pain-related and inflammatory bowel 
diseases with psychiatric diseases. Since the impact of experimental 
gastrointestinal inflammation on the emotional-affective behavior is little 
known, we examined whether experimental gastritis modifies anxiety, stress 
coping and circulating corticosterone in male and female Him:OF1 mice. Gastritis 
was induced by adding iodoacetamide (0.1%) to the drinking water for at least 7 
days. Inflammation was assessed by gastric histology and myeloperoxidase 
activity, circulating corticosterone determined by enzyme immunoassay, 
anxiety-related behavior evaluated with the elevated plus maze and 
stress-induced hyperthermia tests, and depression-like behavior estimated with 
the tail suspension test. Iodoacetamide-induced gastritis was associated with 
gastric mucosal surface damage and an increase in gastric myeloperoxidase 
activity, this increase being significantly larger in female mice than in male 
mice. The rectal temperature of male mice treated with iodoacetamide was 
enhanced, whereas that of female mice was diminished. The circulating levels of 
corticosterone were reduced by 65% in female mice treated with iodoacetamide but 
did not significantly change in male mice. On the behavioral level, 
iodoacetamide treatment caused a decrease in nocturnal home-cage activity, 
drinking and feeding. While depression-related behavior remained unaltered 
following induction of gastritis, behavioral indices of anxiety were 
significantly enhanced in female but not male mice. There was no correlation 
between the estrous cycle and anxiety as well as circulating corticosterone. 
Radiotracer experiments revealed that iodoacetamide did not readily enter the 
brain, the blood-brain ratio being 20:1. Collectively, these data show that 
iodoacetamide treatment causes gastritis in a gender-related manner, its 
severity being significantly greater in female than in male mice. The induction 
of gastritis in female mice is associated with a reduction of circulating 
corticosterone and an enforcement of behavioral indices of anxiety. Gastric 
inflammation thus has a distinct gender-dependent influence on 
emotional-affective behavior and its neuroendocrine control.

Beta N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (Mgat5) deficiency reduces the 
depression-like phenotype in mice.

The central nervous system (CNS) is rich in glycoconjugates, located on cell 
surface and in extracellular matrix. The products of Golgi 
UDP-GlcNAc:N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases (encoded by Mgat1, Mgat2, Mgat4 and 
Mgat5) act sequentially to generate the GlcNAc-branched complex-type N-glycans 
on glycoprotein receptors. While elimination of all the branched N-glycans in 
Mgat1(-/-) mouse embryos is lethal at neural tube fold stage, decreased 
branching is associated with late developmental defects similar to type 2 of 
congenital disorders of glycosylation, with developmental and psychomotor 
abnormalities. To study the role of complex-type N-glycans in brain function, we 
tested Mgat5(-/-) mice in a battery of neurological and behavioral tests. 
Despite the absence of tri- and tetra-antennary products, Mgat5(-/-) mice were 
not different from their wild-type littermates in physical and neurological 
assessments, anxiety level, startle reactivity and sensorimotor gating. However, 
they displayed a robust decrease in the immobility time in the forced swim test 
and the tail suspension test independent of locomotor activity, interpreted as a 
change in depression-like behavior. This effect was accentuated after chronic 
mild stress. Comparable increase in plasma corticosterone of Mgat5(+/+) and 
Mgat5(-/-) mice in response to acute stress shows an intact function of the 
hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. A change in social interactions was also 
observed. Our results indicate that Mgat5 modification of complex-type N-glycans 
on CNS glycoproteins is involved in the regulation of depression-like behavior.

Rodent models provide a valuable approach to elucidating the pathophysiological 
mechanisms underlying the deleterious effects of childhood trauma and stress. 
Neonatal rats and mice emit ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) when separated from 
the dam and litter. USVs are suppressed in rat pups by exposure to the 
putatively infanticidal threat of an adult male. In the present study, C57BL/6J 
mouse pups were exposed to an anaesthetized (non-sire) adult C57BL/6J male for 
3-min/day from postnatal days 2-14, and subsequently tested for anxiety-related 
behaviors (using the novel open field, elevated plus-maze, light/dark 
exploration tests) and depression-related behavior (using the forced swim test) 
at 11 weeks of age. In a separate cohort, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis 
activation was measured via plasma corticosterone levels following either a 
single male-exposure or separation episode. Results showed that pups exposed to 
an adult male emitted significantly fewer USVs than separation-only 
counterparts. Corticosterone levels were significantly lower following single 
exposure to the adult male than separation alone. Repeated neonatal 
male-exposure did not lead to significant alterations in anxiety- or 
depression-related behaviors in adulthood. Taken together, present data suggest 
that the form of adult male-exposure employed did not act as a significant 
stressor, at least in this mouse strain. Further studies will be needed to 
determine whether alternative mouse strains, exposure protocols or adult 
behavioral assays will produce a different pattern of short-term and long-term 
effects.

Enriched environments influence depression-related behavior in adult mice and 
the survival of newborn cells in their hippocampi.

Major depression is a highly prevalent mental disorder and environmental factors 
have been strongly implicated in its pathophysiology. Clinical studies have 
demonstrated that stress or depression can lead to atrophy and cell loss in the 
hippocampus. Studies of animal models of depression have suggested that reduced 
neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus might contribute to such structural 
changes and to the behavior of these animals. On the other hand, increased 
hippocampal neurogenesis can be induced by the administration of antidepressants 
or electroconvulsive seizure, suggesting that increased neurogenesis might be 
related to the treatment of depression. Thus, an enriched environment (EE), 
which also enhances neurogenesis, is expected to have therapeutic effects on 
depression-related behaviors. To investigate the effects of an EE during 
adulthood on these behaviors, we subjected adult mice housed in an EE for five 
weeks to behavioral tests. In an open field test, EE mice exhibited a decrease 
in the distance traveled and an increase in the amount of time spent in the 
center. The startle response was smaller in EE mice than in control mice. EE 
mice also showed reduced immobility time in a forced swim test. The immobility 
time in EE mice was approximately half that observed in mice treated with a 
tricyclic antidepressant, imipramine. In our experimental condition, increased 
survival of newborn cells was observed in EE mice by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine 
(BrdU)-labeled immunohistochemistry. Double-staining of BrdU and a mature neuron 
marker, NeuN, revealed that the majority of surviving cells were neurons. Our 
results suggest that EE, which enhanced the survival of newborn neurons, shows 
beneficial effects on behavioral despair and habituation to a novel environment.

A low-expressing polymorphic variant of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene 
has been associated with emotional disorders in humans and non-human primates 
following exposure to early life trauma. 5-HTT gene knockout (KO) mice exhibit 
increased anxiety- and depression-related behaviors, and provide a model to 
study interactions between 5-HTT gene variation and early life stress. The 
present study assessed the effects of postnatal footshock stress on the 
development of emotion-related behaviors in 5-HTT KO mice. Results showed that 
5-HTT KO mice displayed a profile of suppressed exploratory behavior and 
increased anxiety-like behavior in the light/dark, elevated plus-maze and open 
field tests, as well as increased depression-related behavior in the forced swim 
test following repeated exposure to the test. Postnatal exposure to footshock 
stress did not affect emotion-related behaviors in non-mutant C57BL/6J mice or 
modify phenotypic abnormalities in 5-HTT KO. Data provide further evidence of 
emotional abnormalities following genetic disruption of the 5-HTT.

Adolescence is characterized by behavioral traits such as emotional lability and 
impulsivity that are associated with increased vulnerability to affective 
illness and addictions. Research in rodents has found that adolescent rats and 
mice differ from adults on measures of anxiety-like behavior, novelty seeking 
and stress-responsivity. The present study sought to extend these data by 
evaluating fear-, anxiety- and depression-related behaviors in male C57BL/6J 
mice aged four (early adolescent), six (peri-adolescent) or eight (early adult) 
weeks of age. Age groups were compared on: Pavlovian fear conditioning and 
extinction, anxiety-like behavior and exploratory locomotion (using elevated 
plus-maze and novel open field), and depression-related behavior (via forced 
swim test). Results showed that early adolescent mice exhibited enhanced fear 
conditioning, but extinguished at a similar rate as adults. There were no major 
differences in anxiety-like behavior across age groups, although early 
adolescent and peri-adolescent mice exhibited less exploratory locomotion than 
adults. Depression-related immobility behavior in the forced swim test was lower 
in early adolescents than adult mice across three test exposures. Present 
findings in the C57BL/6J inbred strain add to growing evidence of changes in 
rodent fear- and stress-related behaviors across the developmental transition 
from juvenility through adulthood. Understanding the neural basis of these 
ontogenic changes could provide insight into the pathogenesis and treatment of 
affective disorders that have their origins in adolescence.

Previously, we demonstrated antidepressant-like effect of magnesium (Mg) in the 
forced swim test (FST). Moreover, the joint administration of Mg and imipramine 
(IMI) at ineffective doses per se, resulted in a potent reduction in the 
immobility time in this test. In the present study, we examined the effect of 
immobility stress (IS), and Mg and/or IMI administration on FST behavior. IS 
induced enhancement of immobility time, which was reversed by Mg or IMI at doses 
ineffective in non-stressed mice (10 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg, respectively). The 
joint administration of Mg and IMI was effective in both IS and non-stressed 
animals in FST. IS did not significantly alter locomotor activity, while IMI or 
Mg + IMI treatment in IS mice reduced this activity. We also measured serum and 
brain Mg, IMI and its metabolite desipramine (DMI) concentration in mice 
subjected to FST and injected with Mg + IMI, both restrained and non-restrained. 
In the present study we demonstrated a significant increase (by 68%) in the 
brain IMI and a slight, non-significant reduction in DMI concentration in IS + 
Mg + IMI + FST vs. Mg + IMI + FST groups, which might indicate the reduction in 
brain IMI metabolism. The IS-induced reduction in brain IMI metabolism did not 
participate in the activity in FST, since no differences in such activity were 
noticed between IS + Mg + IMI + FST and Mg + IMI + FST groups. The present data 
suggest that IS-induced increase in immobility time in FST is more sensitive for 
detection antidepressant-like activity. However, further studies are needed to 
examine the effect of other antidepressants in such an experimental paradigm.

BACKGROUND: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is upregulated in the 
hippocampus by antidepressant treatments, and centrally administered BDNF can 
produce antidepressant-like effects in rodent behavioral models of depression. 
BDNF-regulated signaling pathways are thus potential targets for investigation 
of antidepressant mechanisms.
METHODS: We examined the effects of inhibition of MAPK kinase (MEK) in mouse 
behavioral models for depression including interactions with effects of 
antidepressant drugs. We also assessed the behavioral consequences of a 
heterozygous gene deletion for BDNF combined with MEK inhibition or stress.
RESULTS: Acute administration of the MEK inhibitor PD184161 produced 
depressive-like behavior. PD184161 blocked the antidepressant-like effects of 
desipramine and sertraline in the forced swim test and blocked the effects of 
desipramine in the tail suspension test. Heterozygous deletion of BDNF alone did 
not influence behavior in the forced swim test but resulted in a depressive 
phenotype when combined with a low-dose MEK inhibitor or stress exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that acute blockade of MAPK signaling produces a 
depressive-like phenotype and blocks behavioral actions of antidepressants. We 
also demonstrate in BDNF heterozygous knockout mice an example of a how a 
defined genetic alteration can confer vulnerability to a pharmacologic or 
environmental challenge resulting in a depressive behavioral phenotype.

Cytokine-dependent mechanisms in the CNS have been implicated in the 
pathogenesis of depression. Interleukin-6 is upregulated in depressed patients 
and dowregulated by antidepressants. It is, however, unknown whether IL-6 is 
involved in the pathogenesis of depression. We subjected IL-6-deficient mice 
(IL-6(-/-)) to depression-related tests (learned helplessness, forced swimming, 
tail suspension, sucrose preference). We also investigated IL-6 in the 
hippocampus of stressed wild-type mice. IL-6(-/-) mice showed reduced despair in 
the forced swim, and tail suspension test, and enhanced hedonic behavior. 
Moreover, IL-6(-/-) mice exhibited resistance to helplessness. This resistance 
may be caused by the lack of IL-6, because stress increased IL-6 expression in 
wild-type hippocampi. This suggests that IL-6 is a component in molecular 
mechanisms in the pathogenesis of depression. IL-6(-/-) mice represent tools to 
study IL-6-dependent signaling pathways in the pathophysiology of depression in 
vivo. Moreover, these mice may support the screening of compounds for depression 
by altering cytokine-mediated signaling.

Chronic reduction in dietary tryptophan leads to changes in the emotional 
response to stress in mice.

Acute depletion of brain tryptophan (TRP) levels in humans has been used as a 
biochemical model of depression. In this study, we examined the effects of 
consumption of a diet low in TRP on emotional behavior in mice. Specifically, we 
assessed various parameters of emotional behavior in mice fed a TRP-limited diet 
for at least 1 mo. TRP-limited mice showed increased defensive, but not 
offensive, aggression in the resident-intruder test. In the social dominance 
tube test, these mice showed enhanced social dominance. Since defensive 
aggression is thought to be a reflection of not only aggression but also fear, 
these changes in the social behavior of TRP-limited mice are thought to reflect 
changes in their emotional status. TRP-limited mice also showed increased 
locomotor activity and mobility in the open field and forced swim tests, 
respectively, suggesting that their stress/emotional responsiveness was 
enhanced. Importantly, these mice displayed normal levels of anxiety and motor 
performance as determined by the elevated zero maze and open field tests, and 
the rotarod test, respectively, suggesting that their hyperactivity was not due 
to a reduction in anxiety levels or to enhancement of their motor performance. 
Thus, dietary TRP restriction appears to result in alterations in the emotional 
response to stress, in mice.

models in mice.

BACKGROUND: Up to now there have been no satisfactory drugs to treat psychiatric 
disorders, and now bioactive compound from entomagenous fungi (BCEF0083) is a 
new type of bioactive compound from entomopathogenic fungi. Our previous 
investigations have shown that BCEF has an inhibition effect on monoamine 
oxidase. So, BCEF may be a latent antidepressant. This study aimed at observing 
the antidepressant effects and its mechanism of BCEF in the chronic 
unpredictable stress models in mice.
METHODS: The antidepressant effects of BCEF were examined on the chronic 
unpredictable stress models in mice. Sixty mice were randomly divided to six 
groups. Animals were housed and isolated except saline group. Mice were exposed 
to different stressors per day randomly from day 1 to day 21. Body weight were 
weighed on day 1, day 10 and on day 21 during the 21-day stress procedure. 
Awarding response was detected by using method of calculating the 24-hour 
consumption of saccharum water. Step through test was used to evaluate the 
behavioral response. AVP contents in plasma were also detected by using 
radioimmunoassays.
RESULTS: Chronic unpredictable stress resulted in a significant decrease of the 
body weight and could apparently cause escape behavior disturbance and gradual 
reduction of sensitivity to reward in animal models. Drug treatment (BCEF 25, 
50, 100 mg/kg) could significantly ameliorate the decreased body weight and 
effectively reverse the escape behavior disturbance. The gradual reduction of 
sensitivity to reward, the anhedonic state, was also effectively reversed by 
BCEF. BCEF (50, 100 mg/kg) could also effectively restore the AVP content in the 
plasma.
CONCLUSIONS: This evidence suggests that BCEF can effectively inhibit the 
depression behavior and show strong antidepressant effect. BCEF can effectively 
restore the plasma AVP release and this may be an important mechanism of its 
antidepressant effect.

Sex differences in the regulation of serotonergic transmission and behavior in 
5-HT receptor knockout mice.

Jones MD(1), Lucki I.

Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.

Few studies have examined the relationship between genetics, stress, and 
sex-linked differences in neurotransmitter systems. Examining serotonin (5-HT) 
receptor knockout mice on stress-induced behavioral depression, female 5-HT1B 
receptor knockout mice demonstrated significantly reduced immobility than either 
male 5-HT1B receptor knockout mice or male and female wild-type mice on the tail 
suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test. The behavioral phenotype was 
identified as likely due to a disinhibition of 5-HT release, because depletion 
of 5-HT with parachlorophenylalanine selectively reduced immobility of female 
5-HT1B receptor knockout mice in the TST. In contrast, male and female 5-HT1A 
receptor knockout mice demonstrated reduced immobility compared with control 
mice, but the depletion of 5-HT with PCPA did not reverse the 
antidepressant-like phenotype. Microdialysis studies confirmed significantly 
higher baseline levels of hippocampal 5-HT in female, but not male, 5-HT1B 
receptor knockout mice. Both male and female 5-HT1B receptor knockout mice 
demonstrated augmented dialysate responses to fluoxetine. Also, both male and 
female 5-HT1B receptor knockout mice demonstrated reductions of immobility in 
the TST after treatment with fluoxetine. Therefore, female 5-HT1B receptor 
knockout mice demonstrate a sex-linked disinhibition of 5-HT release that 
sustained higher baseline levels of hippocampal 5-HT and behavioral 
vulnerability to 5-HT depletion.

Synaptotagmin IV (Syt IV) is a secretory vesicle protein that is broadly 
expressed in brain and may function as a presynaptic regulator of synaptic 
release. Because Syt IV and abnormalities in neurotransmission have been 
implicated in psychiatric disease, we examined Syt IV (-/-) mice in animal 
models of mood-related behavior. We report that Syt IV (-/-) mice display lower 
levels of anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze and enhanced 
locomotion in the open field. Syt IV (-/-) mice also exhibit reduced 
depression-like behavior and are highly sensitive to the effects of the 
anti-depressant imipramine in a modified Porsolt forced swim test. However, the 
physical restraint-induced stress hormone response is normal in Syt IV (-/-) 
mice. As judged by immunohistochemical criteria, the synaptic structure and 
connectivity of the hippocampus and raphe nucleus in Syt IV (-/-) mice are 
indistinguishable from wild-type littermates. These results indicate that Syt IV 
plays a role in rodent mood-related behavior and suggests Syt IV regulates 
synaptic function in the neuronal networks that modulate these behaviors.

RATIONALE: Galanin and its receptors exert inhibitory neuromodulatory control 
over brain monoamines. Rat studies revealed that galanin expression is 
upregulated by exposure to stressors and that galanin manipulations modify 
neuroendocrine and behavioral responses to stress, leading to the hypothesis 
that galanin mediates depression-related behaviors.
METHODS: In the present study, we examined the role of galanin in modulating 
antidepressant-related behavior in galanin overexpressing transgenic (GAL-tg) 
mice and galanin receptor R1 knockout (GAL-R1 KO) mice, using the tail 
suspension test (TST). Quantitative autoradiography for 5-HT(1A)-R and serotonin 
transporter binding density tested for changes in these two major regulatory 
components of the 5-HT system in galanin mutant mice.
RESULTS: Baseline TST behavior was normal in GAL-tg and GAL-R1 KO mice, and 
intracerebroventricular administration of galanin failed to alter TST behavior 
in normal C57BL/6J mice. The TST anti-immobility effects of acute treatment with 
the serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine (0-30 mg/kg), and the 
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, desipramine (0-30 mg/kg), were unaltered in 
galanin mutant mice. Hippocampal 5-HT(1A)-R density was significantly elevated 
in GAL-tg and GAL-R1 KO mice, while hippocampal 5-HTT density was reduced in 
GAL-R1 KO mice, relative to controls.
CONCLUSION: Neither pharmacological nor molecular genetic manipulations of 
galanin altered depression-related profiles in the TST. Possible functional 
alterations in hippocampal 5-HT neurotransmission may have contributed to these 
negative results. These preliminary findings provide evidence against the 
hypothesis that galanin plays a central role in mouse depression-related 
behaviors. It remains possible that galanin modulates depression-related 
responses in other experimental paradigms and species.

Stress-induced anhedonia in mice is associated with deficits in forced swimming 
and exploration.

In order to develop a model for a depression-like syndrome in mice, we subjected 
male C57BL/6 mice to a 4-week-long chronic stress procedure, consisting of rat 
exposure, restraint stress, and tail suspension. This protocol resulted in a 
strong decrease in sucrose preference, a putative indicator of anhedonia in 
rodents. Interestingly, predisposition for stress-induced anhedonia was 
indicated by submissive behavior in a resident-intruder test. In contrast, most 
mice with nonsubmissive behavior did not develop a decrease in sucrose 
preference and were regarded as nonanhedonic. These animals were used as an 
internal control for stress-induced behavioral features not associated with the 
anhedonic state, since they were exposed to the same stressors as the anhedonic 
mice. Using a battery of behavioral tests after termination of the stress 
procedure, we found that anhedonia, but not chronic stress per se, is associated 
with key analogues of depressive symptoms, such as increased floating during 
forced swimming and decreased exploration of novelty. On the other hand, 
increased anxiety, altered locomotor activity, and loss of body weight were 
consequences of chronic stress, which occurred independently from anhedonia. 
Thus, behavioral correlates of stress-induced anhedonia and of chronic stress 
alone can be separated in the present model.

The ability to modify mice genetically has been one of the major breakthroughs 
in modern medical science affecting every discipline including psychiatry. It is 
hoped that the application of such technologies will result in the 
identification of novel targets for the treatment of diseases such as depression 
and to gain a better understanding of the molecular pathophysiological 
mechanisms that are regulated by current clinically effective antidepressant 
medications. The advent of these tools has resulted in the need to adopt, refine 
and develop mouse-specific models for analyses of depression-like behavior or 
behavioral patterns modulated by antidepressants. In this review, we will focus 
on the utility of current models (eg forced swim test, tail suspension test, 
olfactory bulbectomy, learned helplessness, chronic mild stress, 
drug-withdrawal-induced anhedonia) and research strategies aimed at 
investigating novel targets relevant to depression in the mouse. We will focus 
on key questions that are considered relevant for examining the utility of such 
models. Further, we describe other avenues of research that may give clues as to 
whether indeed a genetically modified animal has alterations relevant to 
clinical depression. We suggest that it is prudent and most appropriate to use 
convergent tests that draw on different antidepressant-related endophenotypes, 
and complimentary physiological analyses in order to provide a program of 
information concerning whether a given phenotype is functionally relevant to 
depression-related pathology.

A significant proportion of patients suffering from major clinical depression 
exhibit sudden bursts of anger often described as "panic attacks without anxiety 
or fear" or "irritability." We investigated aggressive behavior in mice from 
four different inbred strains subjected to unpredictable chronic mild stress 
(UCMS). Our results show that UCMS affects self-grooming behavior, as evaluated 
by the state of an animal's fur, with severity of symptoms differing according 
to genetic background. Furthermore, UCMS increased aggression both in a 
resident-intruder test and between cage-mates. UCMS is therefore a valuable 
model of the problematic aggressive behavior seen in depressive patients.

We investigated the effects of a novel melanocortin-4 (MC4) receptor 
antagonist,1-[(S)-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-isopropylpiperadin-1-yl)ethyl]-4-[4-(2-methoxynaphthalen-1-yl)butyl]piperazine 
(MCL0129) on anxiety and depression in various rodent models. MCL0129 inhibited 
[(125)I][Nle(4)-D-Phe(7)]-alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) 
binding to MC4 receptor with a K(i) value of 7.9 nM, without showing affinity 
for MC1 and MC3 receptors. MCL0129 at 1 microM had no apparent affinity for 
other receptors, transporters, and ion channels related to anxiety and 
depression except for a moderate affinity for the sigma(1) receptor, serotonin 
transporter, and alpha(1)-adrenoceptor, which means that MCL0129 is selective 
for the MC4 receptor. MCL0129 attenuated the alpha-MSH-increased cAMP formation 
in COS-1 cells expressing the MC4 receptor, whereas MCL0129 did not affect basal 
cAMP levels, thereby indicating that MCL0129 acts as an antagonist at the MC4 
receptor. Swim stress markedly induced anxiogenic-like effects in both the 
light/dark exploration task in mice and the elevated plus-maze task in rats, and 
MCL0129 reversed the stress-induced anxiogenic-like effects. Under nonstress 
conditions, MCL0129 prolonged time spent in the light area in the light/dark 
exploration task and suppressed marble-burying behavior. MCL0129 shortened 
immobility time in the forced swim test and reduced the number of escape 
failures in inescapable shocks in the learned helplessness test, thus indicating 
an antidepressant potential. In contrast, MCL0129 had negligible effects on 
spontaneous locomotor activity, Rotarod performance, and hexobarbital-induced 
anesthesia. These observations indicate that MCL0129 is a potent and selective 
MC4 antagonist with anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like activities in various 
rodent models. MC4 receptor antagonists may prove effective for treating 
subjects with stress-related disorders such as depression and/or anxiety.

of stress-related disorders.

The limbic localization of the arginine vasopressin V(1b) receptor has prompted 
speculation as to a potential role of this receptor in the control of emotional 
processes. To investigate this possibility, we have studied the behavioral 
effects of SSR149415, the first selective and orally active non-peptide 
antagonist of vasopressin V(1b) receptors, in a variety of classical (punished 
drinking, elevated plus-maze, and light/dark tests) and atypical (fear/anxiety 
defense test battery and social defeat-induced anxiety) rodent models of 
anxiety, and in two models of depression [forced swimming and chronic mild 
stress (CMS)]. When tested in classical tests of anxiety, SSR149415 produced 
anxiolytic-like activity at doses that ranged from 1 to 30 mg/kg (i.p. or p.o.), 
but the magnitude of these effects was overall less than that of the 
benzodiazepine anxiolytic diazepam, which was used as a positive control. In 
contrast, SSR149415 produced clear-cut anxiolytic-like activity in models 
involving traumatic stress exposure, such as the social defeat paradigm and the 
defense test battery (1-30 mg/kg, p.o.). In the forced swimming test, SSR149415 
(10-30 mg/kg, p.o.) produced antidepressant-like effects in both normal and 
hypophysectomized rats. Moreover, in the CMS model in mice, repeated 
administration of SSR149415 (10 and 30 mg/kg, i.p.) for 39 days improved the 
degradation of the physical state, anxiety, despair, and the loss of coping 
behavior produced by stress. These findings point to a role for vasopressin in 
the modulation of emotional processes via the V(1b) receptor, and suggest that 
its blockade may represent a novel avenue for the treatment of affective 
disorders.

The present study examines gender-related issues in the development of animal 
models of depression and anxiety disorders. Three main issues are discussed: (1) 
gender differences in the prevalence, etiology, and responses to treatments of 
neuropsychiatric disorders. An extensive literature reports that mood disorders 
are more frequent in women compared with men but the great majority of basic 
research has focused on male rodents as animal models; (2) sex-differences in 
behavior reflect both organizational and activational effects of steroid 
hormones, and should be considered in the conceptual frame of the evolutionary 
theory of sexual selection; (3) animal models of anxiety and depression. Social 
stress appears to be a good model to induce anxiety-like and depression-like 
responses, but a large discrepancy in the possibility of inducing social stress 
in the two genders exists. Reliable models of social stress in females are 
needed. The effects of social context, as a possible source of stress, on 
exploration and anxiety in male and female mice were investigated by taking into 
account the natural history and social behavior of this species. Mice housed 
individually for 7 days or with siblings were tested in a free-exploratory 
paradigm of anxiety (where test animals have a choice to stay in their home cage 
or to explore an open field). Individually housed females showed lower 
propensity for exploration and a higher level of anxiety compared with 
group-housed females. Individually housed males tended to show an opposite 
profile. Animal models may contribute to elucidating some aspect of 
neuropsychiatric disorders, but they require consideration of the natural life 
of the animal species studied and of their social behavior in an evolutionary 
perspective.

Tenerife, Canary Islands (Spain).

Maternal stress during pregnancy produced behavioral alterations in both sexes 
with regard to sexual behavior, aggressive, maternal, lateralization and 
depression. In the present paper, sex differences for depression in mice was 
studied. No sex differences between female and male mice groups were observed 
either in swimming-induced immobility or in the open-field test (ambulation, 
rearing and boluses). Prenatal stress produced: 1) an increase of immobility 
time in female mice for swimming-induced immobility, but not in male mice; 2) an 
increase of ambulation in female mice for open-field test, but not in male mice; 
3) there were no significant differences in rearing and boluses between stress 
and control groups either for female or male mice. Prenatal stress increases the 
risk of depression and locomotor activity in adult female mice.

Alpha-1-noradrenergic neurotransmission, corticosterone, and behavioral 
depression.

Stone EA(1), Quartermain D.

BACKGROUND: Impaired brain alpha-1 noradrenergic neurotransmission has been 
implicated in some of the symptoms of depressive illness but has been difficult 
to investigate experimentally because of the insensitivity of current animal 
models of depression. The present experiment addressed this problem by examining 
the effects of pharmacologic blockade and corticosteroid-induced desensitization 
of alpha-1 receptors on two newer, more sensitive models in mice: the inhibition 
of nest-leaving and the tail suspension tests (TST).
METHODS: Male mice were administered either prazosin, betaxolol, atipamezole, 
corticosterone, or repeated restraint stress prior to measurement of either 
nest-leaving or TST. General behavioral function was assessed in horizontal 
wire, swim, and latency to escape footshock tests.
RESULTS: Prazosin increased depressive behavior in the nest-leaving and TSTs, 
whereas corticosterone and restraint stress did so only in the more sensitive 
nest-leaving test. Betaxolol also reduced nest-leaving, suggestive of an alpha-1 
beta-1 receptor synergy. The effects of these agents could not be attributed to 
hypotension, sedation, or general behavioral impairment.
CONCLUSIONS: The fact that a reduction in alpha-1 noradrenergic 
neurotransmission increases depressive behavior, coupled with the fact that this 
change can result from elevated corticosteroid secretion, provides further 
support for a role of this factor in depressive illness. As not all alpha-1 
functions are reduced in depression, it is likely that only a subgroup or 
specific locality of alpha-1 receptors are affected.

Interleukin-1-induced sickness behavior depends on behavioral lateralization in 
mice.

Inter-individual differences in brain-immune interactions have been demonstrated 
previously in mice using lateralization as a behavioral trait of population 
heterogeneity. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is known to induce neurochemical, 
neuroendocrine, and immune responses depending on lateralization, is also able 
to induce sickness behavior, via the production of interleukin-1 (IL-1). The 
objective of this study was to determine whether lateralization can influence 
the behavioral response to LPS and to IL-1. To test this hypothesis, adult 
female C3H mice, previously selected for paw preference in a food reaching task, 
were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 0.75 microg LPS or 0.75 microg 
recombinant IL-1beta. Sickness induced by these molecules was measured by 
depressed social behavior, increased immobility, loss of body weight, and 
reduced food intake during the 6 h following injection. LPS-induced sickness was 
similar in right- and left-pawed mice. In contrast, IL-1-induced sickness 
behavior was dependent on behavioral lateralization. IL-1-induced depression of 
social investigation was more pronounced in right-pawed mice than in left-pawed 
animals. Likewise, IL-1-induced immobility was more important in right-pawed 
mice. There was a similar trend for food intake to be lower and loss of body 
weight to be higher in right-pawed mice than in left-pawed animals. These 
results demonstrate that right-pawed mice are more sensitive to IL-1-induced 
sickness than left-pawed animals. They extend our previous data showing a 
greater susceptibility to stress of right-pawed animals. The existence of 
inter-individual differences in the reactivity to stress or immune activation 
may be useful to study the mechanisms of the various strategies used by an 
individual in response to environmental aggressions.

It is known that repeated stress may result in depression-like alterations of 
behavior. This behavior is characterized by decreased social exploratory 
activity and increase in occurrence of defensive postures in a social 
interaction test in mice. The passive defensive behavior is effectively 
antagonized by antidepressant drugs thus providing a useful animal model of 
depression. Effects of several GABAergic drugs were studied in opponent test in 
individually housed male mice. For two weeks preceding the test, mice were 
repeatedly exposed to foot shock stimulation and/or social confrontation with an 
aggressive mouse. Muscimol, a selective agonist of GABA(A) receptors, decreased 
the frequency and duration of defensive postures and increased the duration of 
some forms of individual activity (grooming and eating), like the agonist of 
GABA(B) receptors baclofen. Muscimol was the only compound that facilitated 
exploratory activity towards an unfamiliar partner and did not suppress the 
locomotion. Effects of another agonist of GABA(B) receptors phenibut and 
inhibitor of GABA transaminase valproate Na were less specific and consisted in 
general suppression of behavior (prevalence of static forms of behavior). It can 
be thought that GABA(A) receptors are essential for regulation of 
depression-like behavior of mice.

[Relationship between learning behavior and genetic factor on immobility shown 
during forced swimming test].

The relationship between learning and genetic factor on immobility in mice 
during a forced swimming test (FST) has been studied. The duration of immobility 
during the FST did not change significantly after the administration of either 
scopolamine (2.5 mg/kg, ip) or cyclohexamine (150 mg/kg, ip), although both 
drugs produced impairment in the learning task. This suggests that the increase 
in immobility observed during the second trial of the FST may not be related to 
learning which could occur during the first trial. Concerning the strain 
difference, first, the duration of immobility in C3H mice was shorter than that 
in ICR, ddY, C57BL and BALB mice. Second, after receiving shock stress in a box, 
ICR, ddY and C57BL mice, but not C3H mice showed a marked decrease in locomotor 
activity when placed in the box again without shock. Also during the FST, both 
C57BL and ddY mice, but not C3H mice showed prolongation of immobility and 
reduction in swimming after shock stress. The changes in locomotor activity, and 
immobility and swimming during the FST caused by shock stress in ddY mice 
recovered to normal levels after treatment with imipramine. From these results, 
it is suggested that the immobility shown during the FST, which may be 
independent of learning and dependent on some genetic factor, is a suitable 
model of depression in animals.

High pressure stress was found to induce immunosuppression accompanied with the 
enhancement of motor activity in mice. Citrus fragrance restored stress-induced 
immunosuppression and induced calm behavior in mice. In the forced swimming test 
using rats, citrus fragrance reduced the total immobility time and potentiated 
the imipramine-induced reduction in total immobility time. The application of 
citrus fragrance to depressive patients made it possible to markedly reduce the 
doses of antidepressants needed for the treatment of patients.

Glutathione as a cerebral substrate in depressive behavior.

Pal SN(1), Dandiya PC.

University), New Delhi, India.

Behavioral depression through inescapable foot shock stress in Swiss albino mice 
was measured on the basis of their performance in an open field test (OFT) and a 
forced swimming test (FST). Glutathione (GSH) and various antidepressants 
(imipramine, maprotiline, fluvoxamine, trazodone, and alprazolam) were able to, 
either fully or partly, prevent and/or reverse the shock-induced behavioral 
depression. The GSH level was measured in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, brain 
stem, and the hypothalamus in shocked mice to ascertain a possible correlation 
between brain GSH and stress-induced depression, under conditions of preshock 
and postshock antidepressant treatments as well as in the absence of the drugs. 
There was an appreciable depletion of cortical GSH in shocked mice that was 
corrected to varying degrees by the different antidepressants. The results 
suggest a close link between stress-induced behavioral depression, increased 
monoaminergic utilization, oxidative stress, and brain GSH.

Sciences, Novosibirsk.

Long experience of defeat in daily social intermale confrontations and permanent 
living with aggressive males under sensory contact conditions [Kudryavtseva (8)] 
has been shown to produce changes in the patterns of submissive behavior of male 
mice of C57BL/6J strain. The submissive males after 20 defeats demonstrated 
passive defense postures instead of active defense and withdrawal which they had 
displayed in first encounters. Moreover, new immobile postures appeared, which 
were very rare in the first confrontations. Submissive animals displayed a 
decrease of ambulation in the open-field test and increase the immobility time 
in the Porsolt's test. Chronic treatment with imipramine prevented the increase 
of "depressiveness" estimated by means of the Porsolt's test. There was a loss 
of weight and some disturbances in gastrointestinal functions. The data are 
discussed in terms of the development of depression in submissive male C57BL/6J 
mice as a result of chronic unavoidable social stress.

[The development of pathological forms of behavior in submissive male C57BL/6J 
mice during agonistic zoosocial interactions. A possible model of depression?].

[Article in Russian]

Kudriavtseva NN, Bakshtanovskaia IV, Popova NK.

It is shown that a long experience of defeats in daily zoosocial collisions (ZC) 
elicits changes in the structure of submissive behaviour. Male mice of C57BL/6J 
line after 20 defeats demonstrated poses of passive subordination instead of 
active defence and run away which they manifested in the first ZC. Moreover, new 
immobile poses appeared which were rare in the first ZC. Submissive animals (CA) 
demonstrated a decrease of travels in the open field test and an increase of 
immobility time in the Porsolt test. Chronic administration of imipramine (10 
mg/kg, i.p., twice a day during two weeks against the background of repeated ZC) 
prevented an increase of depressivity, estimated in Porsolt test. Changes were 
noted in the content of serotonin and 5-HIAA in some brain structures of 
subordinated mice in comparison to control animals (five days of isolation). The 
data are discussed from a position of the development of depression in SA of 
C57BL/6J line as a result of a long nonavoided zoosocial stress.
