Psychological stress induces moderate pathology in the ganglion cell layer in mice.
Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a condition with unclear pathogenesis. Researchers have observed an increased incidence of young Chinese POAG patients who manifest significant psychological stress while their intraocular pressure (IOP) is normal or close to normal; we hypothesize that psychological stress may play a causal role in initiating POAG.
