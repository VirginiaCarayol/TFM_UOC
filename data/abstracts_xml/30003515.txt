Absence of Stress Response in Dorsal Raphe Nucleus in Modulator of Apoptosis 1-Deficient Mice.
Modulator of apoptosis 1 (MOAP-1) is a Bcl-2-associated X Protein (BAX)-associating protein that plays an important role in regulating apoptosis. It is highly enriched in the brain but its function in this organ remains unknown. Studies on BAX-/- mice suggested that disruption of programmed cell death may lead to abnormal emotional states. We thus hypothesize that MOAP-1-/- mice may also display stress-related behavioral differences and perhaps involved in stress responses in the brain and investigated if a depression-like trait exists in MOAP-1-/- mice, and if so, whether it is age related, and how it relates to central serotonergic stress response in the dorsal raphe nucleus. Young MOAP-1-/- mice exhibit depression-like behavior, in the form of increased immobility time when compared to age-matched wild-type mice in the forced swimming test, which is abolished by acute treatment of fluoxetine. This is supported by data from the tail suspension and sucrose preference tests. Repeated forced swimming stress causes an up-regulation of tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) and a down-regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) in young wild-type (WT) control mice. In contrast, TPH2 up-regulation was not observed in aged WT mice. Interestingly, such a stress response appears absent in both young and aged MOAP-1-/- mice. Aged MOAP-1-/- and WT mice also have similar immobility times on the forced swimming test. These data suggest that MOAP-1 is required in the regulation of stress response in the DRN. Crosstalk between BDNF and 5-HT appears to play an important role in this stress response.
