Behavioral despair in mice after prenatal stress.
Maternal stress during pregnancy produced behavioral alterations in both sexes with regard to sexual behavior, aggressive, maternal, lateralization and depression. In the present paper, sex differences for depression in mice was studied. No sex differences between female and male mice groups were observed either in swimming-induced immobility or in the open-field test (ambulation, rearing and boluses). Prenatal stress produced: 1) an increase of immobility time in female mice for swimming-induced immobility, but not in male mice; 2) an increase of ambulation in female mice for open-field test, but not in male mice; 3) there were no significant differences in rearing and boluses between stress and control groups either for female or male mice. Prenatal stress increases the risk of depression and locomotor activity in adult female mice.
