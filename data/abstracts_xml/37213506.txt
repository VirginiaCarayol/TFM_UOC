Implications of gut microbiota dysbiosis and fecal metabolite changes in psychologically stressed mice.
Psychological stress can induce affective disorders. Gut microbiota plays a vital role in emotional function regulation; however, the association between gut microbiota and psychological stress is poorly understood. We investigated effects of psychological stress on the gut microbiome and fecal metabolites and assessed the relationship between affective disorder behavior and altered fecal microbiota.
