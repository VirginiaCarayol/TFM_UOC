[The development of pathological forms of behavior in submissive male C57BL/6J mice during agonistic zoosocial interactions. A possible model of depression?].
It is shown that a long experience of defeats in daily zoosocial collisions (ZC) elicits changes in the structure of submissive behaviour. Male mice of C57BL/6J line after 20 defeats demonstrated poses of passive subordination instead of active defence and run away which they manifested in the first ZC. Moreover, new immobile poses appeared which were rare in the first ZC. Submissive animals (CA) demonstrated a decrease of travels in the open field test and an increase of immobility time in the Porsolt test. Chronic administration of imipramine (10 mg/kg, i.p., twice a day during two weeks against the background of repeated ZC) prevented an increase of depressivity, estimated in Porsolt test. Changes were noted in the content of serotonin and 5-HIAA in some brain structures of subordinated mice in comparison to control animals (five days of isolation). The data are discussed from a position of the development of depression in SA of C57BL/6J line as a result of a long nonavoided zoosocial stress.
