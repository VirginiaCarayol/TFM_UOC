Effects of Bioresonance Application in Mice with Depressive-Like Behavior.
We studied the effects of bioresonance application on mice with depressive-like behavior induced by stress. A chronic mild stress model was developed in mice to monitor the effects of bioresonance application. After that, behavioral tests were performed. In the forced swimming test, the animals of the long bioresonance therapy demonstrated shorter group immobility time in comparison with mice of the stress group and stress group without therapy (animals of this group were sacrificed at the same time point as therapy groups in order to reveal a possibility of spontaneously recover in animals after stress without therapy). In the tail suspension test, a decrease in immobility time was observed in the long bioresonance therapy group, stress group, and stress without therapy group. These changes in behavioral test results can indicate that the application of bioresonance in mice can be an effective method of treating depressive-like behavior, but these conclusions should be supported by additional experimental studies and the use of different frequencies.
