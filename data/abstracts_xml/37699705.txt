How Sucrose Preference Is Gained and Lost: An In-Depth Analysis of Drinking Behavior during the Sucrose Preference Test in Mice.
The sucrose preference test (SPT) is a widely used preclinical assay for studying stress-sensitive reward behaviors and antidepressant treatments in rodents, with some face, construct, and predictive validity. However, while stress-induced loss of sucrose preference is presumed to reflect an anhedonic-like state, little detail is known about what behavioral components may influence performance in the SPT in stress-naive or stressed rodents. We analyzed the licking microstructure of mice during the SPT to evaluate how preference is expressed and lost following chronic stress. In stress-naive mice, preference is expressed as both longer and more numerous drinking bouts at the sucrose bottle, compared with the water bottle. We also found evidence that memory of the sucrose bottle location supports preference. Through manipulations of the caloric content of the sweetener or caloric need of the mouse, we found that energy demands and satiety signals do not affect either preference or the underlying drinking behavior. Both acute and chronic stress impaired sucrose location memory and reduced the number of drinking bouts at the sucrose bottle, the latter of which explained the loss of sucrose preference in stress susceptible mice compared with stress resilient mice. Female mice generally exhibited similar drinking behavior to male mice but may be less susceptible to chronic stress and display better memory performance than male mice, both before and after chronic stress. Our data suggest that chronic stress inhibits a sucrose preference by reducing reward seeking behavior without affecting palatability.
