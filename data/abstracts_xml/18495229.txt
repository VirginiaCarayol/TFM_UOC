Behavioral effects of saredutant, a tachykinin NK2 receptor antagonist, in experimental models of mood disorders under basal and stress-related conditions.
The present study was made to investigate the role of tachykinin NK2 receptors in the expression of stress-related behaviors in animals. Under basal conditions, intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of the selective tachykinin NK2 receptor antagonist, saredutant (1 and 3 mg/kg) or diazepam (1 mg/kg) exerted anxiolytic-like effects in rodents, as they reduced grooming score of Wistar male rats tested in the novelty-induced grooming sampling test (NGT) and increased percentage of time and entries in open arms of Swiss male mice tested in the elevated plus maze (EPM) test. After previous exposure to stress-related conditions, as induced by a 2-min forced swim made 5 min prior to the EPM test, saredutant but not diazepam, exhibited anxiolytic-like effects in mice. To study the antidepressant-like activity of tachykinin NK2 receptor antagonist under basal conditions, different groups of rats were injected i.p. with saredutant (2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg) or the tricyclic antidepressant, clomipramine (50 mg/kg) and tested in the forced swim test (FST), a widely used antidepressant-responsive test. The influence of stress-related conditions was studied in rats subjected to electric foot-shocks (1 mA, 1 s) 24, 5 and 1 h prior to FST, after drugs injection. In the FST, clomipramine decreased the immobility time only under basal conditions, but not after application of acute foot-shocks. To the contrary, saredutant-treated rats also exhibited more active behavior in FST after previous exposure to stressors. These results give further support to the hypothesis that tachykinin NK2 receptors may be a therapeutic target for pharmacological treatment of stress-related diseases, such as anxiety and depression.
