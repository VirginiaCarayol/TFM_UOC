Effects of fluoxetine, tianeptine and olanzapine on unpredictable chronic mild stress-induced depression-like behavior in mice.
Tianeptine is an atypical antidepressant drug that has a different mechanism of action than other antidepressants. Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic drug used for the treatment of schizophrenia. The present study was undertaken to investigate effects of chronic administration of tianeptine or olanzapine on unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS)-induced depression-like behavior in mice compared to a widely used SSRI antidepressant, fluoxetine.
