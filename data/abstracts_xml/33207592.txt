Increasing Î³-Aminobutyric Acid Content in Vegetable Soybeans via High-Pressure Processing and Efficacy of Their Antidepressant-Like Activity in Mice.
This study applied high-pressure processing (HPP) technology to enrich the gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) content in vegetable soybeans and evaluated its antidepressant efficacy on mice, with depression induced by the unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) model. The optimal conditions for HPP, storage time, and storage temperature, as well as antidepressant-like effects of vegetable soybeans, were evaluated and discussed. HPP could effectively and significantly increase GABA content in soybean, with optimum conditions at 200 MPa. The GABA content in the whole vegetable soybean was 436.05 mg/100 g. In mice animal tests, the tail suspension test (TST) showed that the immobility time of the GABA group was significantly shorter than that of the control group. The total travel distance in the open field test (OFT) showed that depressed mice fed with the GABA feed exhibited exploratory behavior. The GABA group showed a significantly higher degree of sucrose preference than the control group. Both results indicate that the GABA feed could effectively alleviate depressive symptomatology. Regarding biochemical parameters, the fecal and serum corticosterone (CORT) levels in the control group increased to 104.86 pg/mg after the onset of depression. In contrast, the fecal CORT level in the GABA group was significantly reduced to 23.98 pg/mg and was comparable to that in the control group (33.38 pg/mg). Reduced serum CORT level in the GABA group suggests an improvement in depressive symptomatology. The serotonin concentration was maintained in the GABA group after the induction of depression, suggesting its preventive activity. The HPP GABA-enriched soybeans exerted modulatory effects on the behaviors of depressed mice and displayed a potential for commercialization.
