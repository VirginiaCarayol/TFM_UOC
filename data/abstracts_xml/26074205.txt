7-Fluoro-1,3-diphenylisoquinoline-1-amine abolishes depressive-like behavior and prefrontal cortical oxidative damage induced by acute restraint stress in mice.
There is a complex relationship between stressful situations and the onset of depression. 7-Fluoro-1,3-diphenylisoquinoline-1-amine (FDPI) has been reported to have an antidepressant-like effect in the forced swimming test (FST). The aim of this study was to investigate the antidepressant-like effect of FDPI administered to mice before or after the acute restraint stress (ARS). The mice were submitted to the ARS for 7 h. Two treatments with FDPI (10 mg/kg) were performed: in the first treatment, the mice received FDPI 30 min before ARS (pre-treatment) and in the second treatment mice received FDPI 10 min after the ARS (post-treatment). Thirty minutes after FDPI administration, the FST and locomotor activity were carried out. ARS induced depressive-like behavior in the FST. Both treatments with FDPI were effective against the increase in immobility time in the FST.Moreover, ARS increased lipid peroxidation and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels as well as decreased catalase activity in prefrontal cortical samples of mice. Pre- and post-treatments with FDPI reduced lipid peroxidation and ROS, and post-treatment restored catalase activity. Superoxide dismutase was not altered by stress and/or FDPI. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) activities increased in the prefrontal-cortices of mice submitted to the ARS protocol and treatments with FDPI abolished this increase. Hepatic MAO activities were not altered in the livers of mice submitted to ARS and FDPI treatments. The serotonin uptake was increased in the prefrontal-cortices of mice submitted to the ARS protocol and both treatments with FDPI abolished this increase. The antidepressant-like effect of FDPI appears to involve the modulation of oxidative stress and the monoaminergic system, without inhibiting hepatic MAO activity.
