Early life stress induces anxiety-like behavior during adulthood through dysregulation of neuronal plasticity in the basolateral amygdala.
Early life stress (ELS) increases the risk of psychiatric diseases such as anxiety disorders and depression in later life. Hyperactivation of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) neurons plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of stress-related diseases. However, the functional roles of BLA neurons in ELS-induced anxiety disorders are not completely understood.
