Liquiritin Alleviates Depression-Like Behavior in CUMS Mice by Inhibiting Oxidative Stress and NLRP3 Inflammasome in Hippocampus.
Central inflammation is generally accepted to be involved in the pathology of depression. We investigated whether liquiritin exerts antidepressant effects by inhibiting central NLRP3 inflammasomes.
