Differential effects of stress exposure via two types of restraint apparatuses on behavior and plasma corticosterone level in inbred male BALB/cAJcl mice.
Restraint stress is one of the most widely used experimental methods for generating rodent models of stress-induced neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety. Although various types of restraint apparatuses have been used to expose animals to stress, the magnitudes of the effects of stress exposure via different types of restraint apparatuses on physiology and behavior have not been compared in the same environment. Here, we investigated the effects of stress exposure via two types of restraint apparatuses on body weight, locomotor activity, anxiety- and depression-related behaviors, and plasma corticosterone levels in mice.
