A comprehensive metabolomics investigation of hippocampus, serum, and feces affected by chronic fluoxetine treatment using the chronic unpredictable mild stress mouse model of depression.
A metabolomic investigation of depression and chronic fluoxetine treatment was conducted using a chronic unpredictable mild stress model with C57BL/6N mice. Establishment of the depressive model was confirmed by body weight measurement and behavior tests including the forced swim test and the tail suspension test. Behavioral despair by depression was reversed by four week-treatment with fluoxetine. Hippocampus, serum, and feces samples collected from four groups (control + saline, control + fluoxetine, model + saline, and model + fluoxetine) were subjected to metabolomic profiling based on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Alterations in the metabolic patterns were evident in all sample types. The antidepressant effects of fluoxetine appeared to involve various metabolic pathways including energy metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis, tryptophan metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and bile acid metabolism. Predictive marker candidates of depression were identified, including β-citryl-L-glutamic acid (BCG) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in serum and chenodeoxycholic acid and oleamide in feces. This study suggests that treatment effects of fluoxetine might be differentiated by altered levels of tyramine and BCG in serum, and that DHA is a potential serum marker for depression with positive association with hippocampal DHA. Collectively, our comprehensive study provides insights into the biochemical perturbations involved in depression and the antidepressant effects of fluoxetine.
