Antidepressant-like effect of CP-101,606: Evidence of mTOR pathway activation.
As a non-competitive N-methyl d-aspartate receptor antagonist, ketamine exerts rapid-onset and long-lasting antidepressant effects on depression, but some side effects limit its use. To identify a safer compound that may provide similar antidepressant effects, here we investigated whether CP-101,606, a selective NR2B receptor inhibitor, provides similar antidepressant effects and explored its underlying mechanisms.
