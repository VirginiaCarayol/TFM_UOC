May the use of different background strains 'strain' the stress-related phenotype of GR+/- mice?
Genetically altered mice are available on different background strains. While respective backcrosses are often performed for pragmatic reasons, e.g. references, comparability, or existing protocols, the interaction between the mutations per se and the background strain often remains a neglected factor. The heterozygous mutation of the glucocorticoid receptor gene (GR) represents a well-examined model for depressive-like behavior in mice. To address the question in how far a robust depressive-like phenotype on a distinct background strain may allow a generalized conclusion, we analyzed respective phenotypes in two commonly used inbred strains: i.) C57BL/6N and ii.) BALB/c. Beside the use of different genetic models, we also extended our approach by applying two alternative paradigms to induce a depressive-like phenotype. Our study therefore comprised the model of 'unpredictable chronic mild stress' (UCMS) for four weeks and 'learned helplessness' (LH), which were used to study the role of GR, a key player in the development of depression. In the course of the experiment two cohorts of male GR+/- mice on either C57BL/6N or BALB/c background strain underwent a behavioral test battery to assess basal and depressive-like features. While both stress paradigms were functional in inducing depressive-like changes, the results were strictly strain-dependent. The genetic consequences became even more obvious under non-stress conditions with significant effects detected in BALB/c mice, which indicates a different basal stress predisposition due to differences in the genetic background.
