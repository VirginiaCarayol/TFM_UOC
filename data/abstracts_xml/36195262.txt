Swimming exercise ameliorates depressive-like behavior by anti-inflammation activity, rebalancing gut Escherichia coli and Lactobacilli.
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common mental disease with high morbidity, recurrence and mortality and is a serious global health problem.Aerobic exercise produces beneficial effects on depression and associated comorbidities.Swimming exercise with high motor complexity may be particularly beneficial for patients with depression.We hypothesized that swimming exercise improves various types of depression-like behaviors and these effects are related to improved immune and inflammatory response by regulating microbiota-gut-brain axis.We established the Lipopolysaccharides (LPS)/Chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) mice model of depression. The forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST) were used as predictive animal models of antidepressant-like activity.Swimming exercise significantly decreased the duration of immobility in FST and TST.We found that swimming exercise could significantly decrease the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the central nervous system (CNS). Shifts in the composition of the gut microbiota were significant in depression model induced by LPS/CUS, notably as decreases in lactobacilli and increases in escherichia coli (E. coli), which were reversed byswimming exercise. Current study indicated that swimming exercise has huge potential for antidepressant therapy, and gut microbiotaplays an important role inregulating inflammation. We are pleased that current can study reveal a potentially promising method with less adverse reaction for combating depression and open up an important new area for future research.
