The selenocompound 1-methyl-3-(phenylselanyl)-1H-indole attenuates depression-like behavior, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation in streptozotocin-treated mice.
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a chronic mental illness affecting a wide range of people worldwide. The pathophysiology of MDD is not completely elucidated, but it is believed that oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are involved. In light with this, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether a single administration of the antioxidant 1-methyl-3-(phenylselanyl)-1H-indole (MFSeI) was able to reverse the streptozotocin-induced depression-like behavior, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation in mice. MFSeI (10 mg/kg) was administered intragastrically (i.g.) 24 h after the intracerebroventricular injection of STZ (0.2 mg/4 μL/per mouse). Thirty minutes after MFSeI administration, behavioral tests and neurochemical analyses were performed. Fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, i.g.) was used as a positive control. MFSeI and fluoxetine were able to reverse the STZ-induced depression-like behavior, as evidenced by decreased immobility time in the forced swimming test and increased grooming time in the splash test. Mechanistically, MFSeI reversed the increased levels of reactive species and lipid peroxidation in the prefrontal cortices and hippocampi of STZ-treated mice. Additionally, neuroinflammation (i.e. expression of NF-κB, IL-1β, and TNF-α) and the reduced mRNA levels of BDNF in the and hippocampi of depressed mice were reversed by treatment with MFSeI. Fluoxetine did not improve the STZ-induced alterations at the levels of reactive species, NF-κB and BDNF in the prefrontal cortices neither the levels of TNF-α in both brain regions. Together, these data suggest that the MFSeI may be a promising compound with antidepressant-like action, reducing oxidative stress and modulating inflammatory pathways in the brain of depressed mice.
