Antidepressant Effects of Rhodomyrtone in Mice with Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress-Induced Depression.
Rhodomyrtone is one of the main active compounds derived from Rhodomyrtus tomentosa, which belongs to the Myrtaceae family. In the current study, we investigated the properties of rhodomyrtone as a potential drug candidate for the treatment of stress-caused depression.
