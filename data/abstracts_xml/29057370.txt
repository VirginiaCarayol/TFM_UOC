Conditional Human Immunodeficiency Virus Transactivator of Transcription Protein Expression Induces Depression-like Effects and Oxidative Stress.
The prevalence of major depression in those with HIV/AIDS is substantially higher than in the general population. Mechanisms underlying this comorbidity are poorly understood. HIV-transactivator of transcription (Tat) protein, produced and excreted by HIV, could be involved. We determined whether conditional Tat protein expression in mice is sufficient to induce depression-like behaviors and oxidative stress. Further, as oxidative stress is associated with depression, we determined whether decreasing or increasing oxidative stress by administering methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) or diethylmaleate (DEM), respectively, altered depression-like behavior.
