FK506 binding protein 5 shapes stress responsiveness: modulation of neuroendocrine reactivity and coping behavior.
The Hsp90 cochaperone FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5) is an established regulator of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and numerous genetic studies have linked it to stress-related diseases such as major depression or posttraumatic stress disorder. However, translational studies including genetic animal models are lacking.
