Puerarin ameliorates depression-like behaviors of with chronic unpredictable mild stress mice by remodeling their gut microbiota.
Puerarin is an isoflavone derivative isolated from the traditional Chinese medicine Pueraria Lobelia, which has proven to relieve depression-like behavior. However, its underlying antidepressant mechanisms have been poorly characterized. Herein, we explored whether Puerarin's antidepressant effect is associated with changes in the gut microbiota (GM).
