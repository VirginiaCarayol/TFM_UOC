Differential effect of chronic mild stress on anxiety and depressive-like behaviors in three strains of male and female laboratory mice.
Major depressive disorder is the most common psychiatric disorder worldwide. To understand mechanisms and search for new approaches to treating depression, animal models are crucial. Chronic mild stress (CMS) is the most used animal model of depression. Although CMS is considered a robust model of depression, conflicting results have been reported for emotion-related behaviors, which the intrinsic characteristics of each rodent strain could explain. To further shed light on the impact of genetic background on the relevant parameters commonly addressed in depression, we examined the effect of 4-weeks CMS on anxiety and depression-related behaviors and body weight gain in three strain mice (BALB/c, C57BL/6, and CD1) of both sexes. CMS reduced body weight gain in C57BL/6NCrl and CD1 male mice. C57BL/6 animals exhibited a more pronounced anxious-like behavior than CD1 and BALB/c mice in the light-dark box (LDB) and the elevated plus maze (EPM) tests, whereas BALB/c animals exhibited the more robust depressive-like phenotype in the splash test (ST), tail suspension test (TST) and forced-swimming test (FST). Under CMS, exposure did not affect anxiety-related behaviors in any strain but induced depression-like behaviors strain-dependently. CMS C57BL/6 and CD1 mice of both sexes showed depression-like behaviors, and CMS BALB/c male mice exhibited reduced depressive behaviors in the FST. These results suggest a differential effect of stress, with the C57BL/6 strain being more vulnerable to stress than the CD1 and BALB/c strain mice. Furthermore, our findings emphasize the need for researchers to consider mouse strains and behavioral tests in their CMS experimental designs.
