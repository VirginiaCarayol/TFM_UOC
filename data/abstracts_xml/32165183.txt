Hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis imbalance and inflammation contribute to sex differences in separation- and restraint-induced depression.
Whether social contact contributes to the underlying mechanisms of depression and the observed sex differences is unclear. In this study, we subjected young male and female mice to separation- and restraint-induced stress for 4 weeks and assessed behaviors, neurotransmitter levels, hormones, and inflammatory cytokines. Results showed that, compared with controls, male mice exposed to stress displayed significant decreases in body weight and sucrose preference after 1 week. In the fourth week, they exhibited a higher degree of anxiety (open field test) and depressive-like behavior (forced swim test). Moreover, the males showed significant decreases in monoamine neurotransmitters, including norepinephrine and dopamine in striatum, and an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin 1β in serum. In contrast, females showed persistent loss of weight during stress and displayed significant decreases in sucrose preference after stress. Importantly, the females but not males showed activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, with significantly higher levels adrenocorticotropic hormone. Additionally, mRNA level of c-fos and AVP showed there was significant interaction between stress and sex. Finally, we conclude that an imbalance of the HPA axis and inflammation might be important contributors to sex differences in separation/restraint-induced depressive behavior and that changes might be mediated by c-fos and AVP.
