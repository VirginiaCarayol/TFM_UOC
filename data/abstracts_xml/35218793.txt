Lower antidepressant response to fluoxetine is associated with anxiety-like behavior, hippocampal oxidative imbalance, and increase on peripheral IL-17 and IFN-γ levels.
Major depression is a leading contributor to the global burden of disease. This is mainly related to the disorder chronic and recurrent nature, and to high rates of refractoriness to treatment. Limited efficacy with currently available antidepressants highlights the need for more effective options for treating drug-resistant patients and emphasizes the importance of developing specific preclinical models for treatment-resistant populations. Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is commonly defined as failure to respond to two or more trials of antidepressants. In this study, we investigated the effect of fluoxetine treatment for fourteen days on the depressive-like behavior and the oxidative and inflammatory parameters of mice submitted to chronic corticosterone administration. After 21 days of subcutaneous corticosterone administration (20 mg/kg/day) and 14 days of oral fluoxetine treatment (10 mg/kg/day, started on day 7 of induction protocol), we separated animals into two groups according to the tail suspension test (TST) results: antidepressant responders (good response to antidepressant, GRA) and non-responders (resistance to antidepressant, AR). Forced swimming test (FST), elevated plus maze test (EPMT), and open field test (OFT) were performed. We found that animals classified as AR (i.e., those with higher immobility values in the TST) demonstrated anxiety-like behavior in the EPMT, increased H2O2 levels, and decreased catalase activity in the hippocampus, as well as increased serum levels of IL-17 and IFN-γ. Our findings suggest that a redox imbalance in the hippocampus, combined with increased levels of peripheral IL-17 and INF-γ, may be involved with an impaired response to fluoxetine.
