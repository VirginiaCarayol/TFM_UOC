Effects of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine lesion of the dorsal raphe nucleus on the antidepressant-like action of tramadol in the unpredictable chronic mild stress in mice.
Tramadol is a centrally acting clinically effective analgesic, with a weak opioid receptor affinity. It shows antidepressant-like effects in animal models such as forced swimming test, learned helplessness, and unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) and enhances the concentrations of noradrenaline (NA) and serotonin (5-HT) by interfering with their reuptake and release mechanisms, like some antidepressants.
