A role for MAP kinase signaling in behavioral models of depression and antidepressant treatment.
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is upregulated in the hippocampus by antidepressant treatments, and centrally administered BDNF can produce antidepressant-like effects in rodent behavioral models of depression. BDNF-regulated signaling pathways are thus potential targets for investigation of antidepressant mechanisms.
