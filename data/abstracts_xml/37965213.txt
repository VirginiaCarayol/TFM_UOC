Adolescent traumatic brain injury leads to incremental neural impairment in middle-aged mice: role of persistent oxidative stress and neuroinflammation.
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) increases the risk of mental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases in the chronic phase. However, there is limited neuropathological or molecular data on the long-term neural dysfunction and its potential mechanism following adolescent TBI.
