Quercetin protects against stress-induced anxiety- and depression-like behavior and improves memory in male mice.
The present study evaluates the protective role of Quercetin (Quer), against immobilization stress- induced anxiety, depression and cognition alteration in mice using behavioral and biochemical parameters. 24 adult Albino mice were distributed into 2 groups vehicle (n=12; 1 ml/kg) and Quer injected (n=12; 20 mg/kg/ml). The animals received their respective treatment for 14 days. On day 15, after the drug administration, animals were sub-divided into 4 groups (n=6); (i) unstressed + vehicle; (ii) stressed + vehicle; (iii) unstressed + Quer; (iv) stressed + Quer. On day 16, 24 h after the immobilization stress behavioral activities (light-dark activity, elevated plus maze, Morris water maze, and forced swim test) monitored and then animals were decapitated 1 h after the drug administration. Brain samples were collected for biochemical (antioxidant enzymes, AChE, ACh, 5-HT and its metabolite) analysis. The present study indicates the Quer reversed the stress-induced anxiety and depression, in addition, memory performance was more enhanced in stressed group. Following the treatment of Quer, stress-induced elevation of lipid peroxidation and suppression of antioxidant enzymes were also reversed. Administration of Quer decreased AChE in unstressed, while levels of acetylcholine were increased in vehicle and Quer treated stressed animals. The metabolism of 5-HT was increased in Quer treated stressed than unstressed animals. In conclusion, the present finding showed that Quer could prevent the impairment of antioxidant enzymes and also regulate the serotonergic and cholinergic neurotransmission and produce antianxiety, antidepressant effect and enhance memory following 2 h immobilization stress in mice.
