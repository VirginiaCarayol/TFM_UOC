Effects of liraglutide on depressive behavior in a mouse depression model and cognition in the probe trial of Morris water maze test.
We investigated the effects of liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist, on a depression-like phenotype in mice exposed to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). Learning and memory were also assessed using the Morris water maze (MWM) test.
