Involvement of norepinephrine and serotonin system in antidepressant-like effects of hederagenin in the rat model of unpredictable chronic mild stress-induced depression.
Previous studies from our laboratory indicated that both acute and subchronic administration of Fructus Akebiae (FAE) [the fruit of Akebiae quinata (Thunb.) Decne, (Lardizabalaceae)] produce antidepressant-like effects in animal depressive behavior tests. FAE contains approximately 70% of hederagenin (HG) as its main chemical component.
