Alpha-1-noradrenergic neurotransmission, corticosterone, and behavioral depression.
Impaired brain alpha-1 noradrenergic neurotransmission has been implicated in some of the symptoms of depressive illness but has been difficult to investigate experimentally because of the insensitivity of current animal models of depression. The present experiment addressed this problem by examining the effects of pharmacologic blockade and corticosteroid-induced desensitization of alpha-1 receptors on two newer, more sensitive models in mice: the inhibition of nest-leaving and the tail suspension tests (TST).
