QCM-4 a novel 5-HT3 antagonist attenuates the behavioral and biochemical alterations on chronic unpredictable mild stress model of depression in Swiss albino mice.
The inconsistent therapeutic outcome necessitates identifying novel compounds for the treatment of depression. Therefore, the present study is aimed at evaluating the antidepressant-like effects of a novel 5-HT3 receptor antagonist 3-methoxy-N-p-tolylquinoxalin-2-carboxamide (QCM-4) on chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) induced behavioral and biochemical alterations in mice.
