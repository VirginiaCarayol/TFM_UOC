[Effect of antiasthenic drug ladasten on the level of cytokines and behavior in experimental model of anxious depression in C57BL/6 male mice].
Effects of the antiasthenic drug ladasten [N-(2-adamantyl)-N-(para-bromophenyl)amine] on the profile of cytokines, behavior, and indexes of immunity organs was studied on zoosocial stress model in depressed C57BL/6 male mice. The anxious depression state in male mice was formed by repeated agonistic interactions according to the sensory contact model. Ladasten (30 mg/kg, i.p.) and reference drug imipramine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) were administered either once after 3-day stressor interaction or for 5 days after 10-day interaction. The concentration of cytokines in blood serum was determined by flow cytometry method. The behavioral changes were studied using an actometer and the elevated plus-maze test. The parameters were studied 24 h after last drug injection. Different stages of depression were manifested by behavioral impairments, increased concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-17, and IL-4, and decreased indexes of immunity organs. Ladasten induced (more significantly than imipramine) a decrease in the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-17 and IL-4, removed behavioral changes, and restored indexes of immunity organs. Thus, the antiasthenic drug ladasten limits development of the anxious depressive state and suppresses the level ofproinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-17 and IL-4. These findings suggest that ladasten is a possible candidate drug for adjuvant therapy of depressive disorders.
