A time-dependent history of mood disorders in a murine model of neuropathic pain.
Chronic pain is clinically associated with the development of affective disorders. However, studies in animal models of neuropathic pain are contradictory and the relationship with mood disorders remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to characterize the affective consequences of neuropathic pain over time and to study potential underlying mechanisms.
