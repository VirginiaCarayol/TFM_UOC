Adaptogenic effects of curcumin on depression induced by moderate and unpredictable chronic stress in mice.
Curcumin has been investigated for the prevention and treatment of diseases due to its anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and neuroprotective actions. This current study evaluated the adaptogenic effects of a subchronic oral administration of curcumin to Swiss mice that were submitted to a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model of depression. Four groups of mice (vehicle control, CO; curcumin control, COC; CUMS + vehicle, CUMS; CUMS + curcumin, CUMSC) were evaluated for the biochemical parameters. The CUMS model caused depressive-like and anxiety-like behavior in the animals when they were viewed in the Forced Swimming Test and in the Elevated Plus Maze Test. The treatments with curcumin prevented the depressive-like behavior in the Forced Swimming Test and they had anxiolytic effects on the non-stressed animals. This was confirmed by the Elevated Plus Maze Test. Curcumin showed antioxidant effects (IC50 of 38.86 ± 1.78 μg/mL) in the in vitro DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrozole) test. The compound also showed antioxidant effects in vivo, increasing the catalase (CAT) levels in the brains of the stressed animals. The biochemical analyses did not reveal potential renal and hepatic damage. Together, these results have demonstrated the antidepressant and antioxidant effects of curcumin, highlighting in this mice model, the compound's novel adaptogenic potential.
