Effect of Electroacupuncture at GV20 on Sleep Deprivation-Induced Depression-Like Behavior in Mice.
Accumulating evidence suggests that sleep deprivation (S-Dep) is a critical risk factor for depression. Electroacupuncture (EA) treatment has been reported to ameliorate posttraumatic stress disorder- (PSTD-) like behavior and enhance hippocampal neurogenesis. However, whether EA treatment has any beneficial effect on S-Dep-induced depression-like behavior is still unknown. In the present study, we focused on whether EA at Baihui (GV20) can ameliorate the deterioration effect of S-Dep in mice. Mice were randomly divided into normal, S-Dep, S-Dep + EA, and S-Dep + sham EA groups. Cognitive behavior test and in vitro assay were performed separately to avoid the influence of behavior test on synaptic transmission and protein expression. Depression-like behaviors were determined by forced swimming test (FST), tail suspension test (TST), and Morris water maze (MWM). Neurogenesis was identified by BrdU, DCX, and NeuN immunofluorescence staining. In vitro long-term potentiation was detected by high frequency stimulation (HFS) at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses in hippocampal slices. Brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) protein expression level were assayed by western blot. Our results indicated that D-Sep mice demonstrated depression-like behaviors determined by prolonged immobility duration in FST and TST; D-Sep mice also manifested spatial memory retention deficit in MWM. Furthermore, EA treatment ameliorated D-Sep-induced depression-like behaviors and spatial memory retention deficit. Mechanically, EA treatment alleviated neuron progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation, ameliorated the field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) slope impaired by S-Dep, and elevated BDNF/TrkB protein expression. Taken together, our data suggested that EA treatment has a protective effect on S-Dep-induced depression-like behavior and cognitive impairment, which may be through regulating BDNF/TrkB protein expression.
