Higher susceptibility of somatostatin 4 receptor gene-deleted mice to chronic stress-induced behavioral and neuroendocrine alterations.
The somatostatin 4 receptor (sst4) is widely expressed in stress-related brain areas (e.g. hippocampus, amygdala) and regulates the emotional behavior in acute situations. Since its importance in chronic stress-induced complex pathophysiological alterations is unknown, we investigated the involvement of sst4 in the responsiveness to chronic variable stress (CVS). Sstr4 gene-deficient (Sstr4-/-) mice and their wildtype counterparts (Sstr4+/+) were used to examine the behavioral and neuroendocrine alterations as well as chronic neuronal activity (FosB expression) changes in response to CVS. In Sstr4+/+ mice, there was no behavioral response to the applied CVS paradigm. In contrast, immobility time in the tail suspension test increased after the CVS in the knockouts. In the forced swim test, Sstr4-/- animals showed increased baseline immobility and then it decreased after the CVS. Light-dark box and open field test behaviors and sucrose preference did not respond to the stress in the knockouts. Adrenal weights increased and thymus weights decreased in both Sstr4+/+ and Sstr4-/- mice demonstrating the effect of chronic stress. The relative adrenal weight of stressed knockouts increased to a greater extent, while relative thymus and body weights decreased only in the Sstr4-/- mice. Basal plasma corticosterone concentrations did not change after the CVS in either genotype. FosB immunopositivity in the central and basolateral amygdaloid nuclei was enhanced in stressed knockouts, but not in wild types. This is the first evidence that sst4 activation is involved in the behavioral and neuroendocrine alterations induced by chronic stress with a crucial role of plastic changes in the amygdala.
