Paeoniflorin attenuates impairment of spatial learning and hippocampal long-term potentiation in mice subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress.
Paeoniflorin has been reported to exhibit antidepressant-like effects in several animal model depression; and it also exerts a neuroprotective effect. In the present study, we investigated the effects of paeoniflorin administration on depression-like behaviors and cognitive abilities in mice subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), an animal model associated with depressive disorders and cognitive deficits.
