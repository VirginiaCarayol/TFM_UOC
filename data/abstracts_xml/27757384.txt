Effects of creatine monohydrate supplementation and exercise on depression-like behaviors and raphe 5-HT neurons in mice.
The effects of creatine and exercise on chronic stress-induced depression are unclear. In the present study, we identified the effects of 4-week supplementation of creatine monohydrate and/or exercise on antidepressant behavior and raphe 5-HT expression in a chronic mild stress-induced depressed mouse model.
