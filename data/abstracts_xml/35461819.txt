3,3'-Diindolylmethane and 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid prevent chronic mild stress induced depressive-like behaviors in female mice.
Current pharmaceutical treatments for depression are sometimes ineffective and may have unwanted side effects that interfere with patient compliance. This study examined the potential antidepressant-like effects of dietary- and microbial-derived aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligands, 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) and 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (1,4-DHNA).
