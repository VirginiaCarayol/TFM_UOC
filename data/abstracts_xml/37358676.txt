Intranasal Monophosphoryl Lipid a Administration Ameliorates depression-like Behavior in Chronically Stressed Mice Through Stimulation of Microglia.
We and others have reported that systematic stimulation of the central innate immune system by a low dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can improve depression-like behavior in chronically stressed animals. However, it is unclear whether similar stimulation by intranasal administration could improve depression-like behavior in animals. We investigated this question using monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), a derivative of LPS that lacks the adverse effects of LPS but is still immuno-stimulatory. We found that a single intranasal administration of MPL at a dose of 10 or 20 µg/mouse, but not at a dose of 5 µg/mouse, ameliorated chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)-induced depression-like behavior in mice, as evidenced by the decrease in immobility time in tail suspension test and forced swimming test and the increase in sucrose intake in sucrose preference test. In the time-dependent analysis, the antidepressant-like effect of a single intranasal MPL administration (20 µg/mouse) was observed 5 and 8 h but not 3 h after drug administration and persisted for at least 7 days. Fourteen days after the first intranasal MPL administration, a second intranasal MPL administration (20 µg/mouse) still showed an antidepressant-like effect. The innate immune response mediated by microglia might mediate the antidepressant-like effect of intranasal MPL administration, because both inhibition of microglial activation by pretreatment with minocycline and depletion of microglia by pretreatment with PLX3397 prevented the antidepressant-like effect of intranasal MPL administration. These results suggest that intranasal administration of MPL can produce significant antidepressant-like effects in animals under chronic stress conditions via stimulation of microglia.
