Rosiglitazone treatment reversed depression- but not psychosis-like behavior of db/db diabetic mice.
The objective of the present study was to examine the effect of long-term management of insulin resistance and hyperglycemia on neurobehavioral deficits in db/db mice. In this study, 5-week-old db/db and lean control mice were fed with rosiglitazone (20 mg/kg/day) mixed or standard chow for a duration of 5 weeks. Mice were monitored weekly for blood glucose concentration. Five weeks after the onset of treatment, they were subjected to the forced swim test (FST), pre-pulse inhibition (PPI), open field test (OFT) and fear-potentiated startle (FPS) test to examine for depression, psychosis-like behavior, locomotor activity and emotional learning, respectively. Rosiglitazone normalized hyperglycemia and improved glucose tolerance. Rosiglitazone significantly reduced immobility time in the FST in db/db mice, suggesting an antidepressant-like effect. However, rosiglitazone failed to reverse disruption of PPI in db/db mice, indicating its ineffectiveness against psychosis-like behavior. In the OFT, rosiglitazone did not affect the activity of db/db mice, suggesting its antidepressant-like effect was independent of changes in locomotor activity. In the FPS test, db/db mice showed impaired emotional learning and rosiglitazone failed to correct it. In conclusion, long-term blood glucose management in type-2 diabetics may help to limit the co-occurrence of depression but not the psychotic symptoms and ability to cope with stress.
