Stress-induced changes in social dominance are scaled by AMPA-type glutamate receptor phosphorylation in the medial prefrontal cortex.
The establishment and maintenance of social dominance are critical for social stability and the survival and health of individual animals. Stress lead to depression and a decrease in the social status of depressed persons is a risk factor for suicide. Therefore, we explored the mechanistic and behavioral links among stress, depression, and social dominance and found that mice subjected to chronic restraint stress (CRS), an animal model of stress-induced depression, showed decreased social dominance as measured by a dominance tube test. Importantly, this submissive behavior was occluded by the antidepressant, fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. It is known that social dominance is controlled by synaptic efficacy in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and that AMPA-type glutamate receptor (AMPA-R) is a key molecule for synaptic efficacy. We found that the phosphorylation on AMPA-R was bidirectionally changed by CRS and fluoxetine in the mPFC of mice with CRS. Moreover, we found a strong correlation between social dominance and AMPA-R phosphorylation that regulates synaptic efficacy by modulating the synaptic targeting of AMPA-R. Our correlational analysis of the behavior and biochemistry of the CRS model suggests that AMPA-R phosphorylation in the mPFC may serve as a biomarker of social dominance related to stress.
