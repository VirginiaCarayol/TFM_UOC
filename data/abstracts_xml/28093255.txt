NLRP3 gene knockout blocks NF-ÎºB and MAPK signaling pathway in CUMS-induced depression mouse model.
Abundant researches indicate that neuroinflammation has important roles in the pathophysiology of depression. Our previous study found that the NLRP3 inflammasome mediated stress-induced depression-like behavior in mice via regulating neuroinflammation. However, it still remains unclear that how the NLRP3 inflammasome influences related inflammatory signaling pathway to contribute to neuroinflammation in depression.
