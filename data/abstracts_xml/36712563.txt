Antidepressant Response and Stress Resilience Are Promoted by CART Peptides in GABAergic Neurons of the Anterior Cingulate Cortex.
A key challenge in the understanding and treatment of depression is identifying cell types and molecular mechanisms that mediate behavioral responses to antidepressant drugs. Because treatment responses in clinical depression are heterogeneous, it is crucial to examine treatment responders and nonresponders in preclinical studies.
