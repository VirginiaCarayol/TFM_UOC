Reduction in endogenous cardiac steroids protects the brain from oxidative stress in a mouse model of mania induced by amphetamine.
Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe mental illness characterized by episodes of mania and depression. Numerous studies have implicated the involvement of endogenous cardiac steroids (CS), and their receptor, Na+, K+ -ATPase, in BD. The aim of the present study was to examine the role of brain oxidative stress in the CS-induced behavioral effects in mice.
