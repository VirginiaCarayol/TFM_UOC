Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors regulate the interrelation between 5-HT and inflammation after myocardial infarction.
Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a main cause of death all around the world. There is a close relationship between myocardial infarction (MI) and depression. MI patients with untreated depression had higher mortality than those without depression. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the effect of escitalopram in treating a model under MI and unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS).
