Comprehensive behavioral analysis and quantification of brain free amino acids of C57BL/6J congenic mice carrying the 1473G allele in tryptophan hydroxylase-2.
Tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (Tph2) is a rate-limiting enzyme for the biosynthesis of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin). Previous studies have reported that C1473G polymorphism of the murine Tph2 gene leads to decreased 5-HT levels in the brain and abnormal behavioral phenotypes, such as impaired anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. In this study, to confirm the effect of the C1473G polymorphism on mouse phenotypes, we conducted a comprehensive battery of behavioral tests and measured the amounts of brain free amino acids involved in the production of 5-HT.
