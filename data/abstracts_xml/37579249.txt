Yamogenin Exhibits Antidepressant-like Effects via Inhibition of ER Stress and Microglial Activation in LPS-Induced Mice.
Depression is a multifaceted psychiatric disorder that affects a significant number of individuals worldwide, and its pathophysiology encompasses a variety of mechanisms, including the induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which has been correlated with depressive-like behaviors in animal models. Yamogenin, a bioactive compound derived from traditional Chinese medicine Dioscorea species, possesses diverse pharmacological properties. This investigation aimed to explore the antidepressant-like effects of yamogenin and the underlying mechanisms involved. By utilizing a murine model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depressive-like behavior, we demonstrated that yamogenin enhanced sucrose preference and reduced immobility time in the forced swimming test. These effects were observed alongside the attenuation of ER stress through modulation of the PERK/eIF2Î±/ATF4/CHOP signaling pathway in the prefrontal cortex. Moreover, yamogenin augmented the expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 while diminishing the expression of the proapoptotic protein caspase-3. Additionally, yamogenin exhibited inhibitory effects on microglial activation but did not elicit the promotion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling. Collectively, our findings propose that yamogenin exerts antidepressant-like effects in LPS-induced mice by inhibiting ER stress and microglial activation. This study contributes novel insights into the potential utilization of yamogenin as a natural antidepressant agent.
