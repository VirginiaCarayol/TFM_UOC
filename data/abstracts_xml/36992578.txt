Electroacupuncture Improves Depression-Like Behavior by Regulating the Abundance of Lactobacillus and Staphylococci in Mice.
Growing evidence suggests that gut microbiota can affect depression-like behavior, and electroacupuncture (EA) can regulate the composition and abundance of gut microbiota. At the same time, not a lot of research has been done on how EA affects gut microbiota to depression-like behavior. The objective of this study was to study the associated mechanisms by which EA exerts antidepressant effects by modulating gut microbiota.
