[Relationship between learning behavior and genetic factor on immobility shown during forced swimming test].
The relationship between learning and genetic factor on immobility in mice during a forced swimming test (FST) has been studied. The duration of immobility during the FST did not change significantly after the administration of either scopolamine (2.5 mg/kg, ip) or cyclohexamine (150 mg/kg, ip), although both drugs produced impairment in the learning task. This suggests that the increase in immobility observed during the second trial of the FST may not be related to learning which could occur during the first trial. Concerning the strain difference, first, the duration of immobility in C3H mice was shorter than that in ICR, ddY, C57BL and BALB mice. Second, after receiving shock stress in a box, ICR, ddY and C57BL mice, but not C3H mice showed a marked decrease in locomotor activity when placed in the box again without shock. Also during the FST, both C57BL and ddY mice, but not C3H mice showed prolongation of immobility and reduction in swimming after shock stress. The changes in locomotor activity, and immobility and swimming during the FST caused by shock stress in ddY mice recovered to normal levels after treatment with imipramine. From these results, it is suggested that the immobility shown during the FST, which may be independent of learning and dependent on some genetic factor, is a suitable model of depression in animals.
