Impaired emotional response to stress in mice lacking galectin-1 or galectin-3.
Galectin-1 (Gal-1) and galectin-3 (Gal-3) are multifunctional glycan-binding proteins, expressed in the brain and in its limbic structures that are involved in behavioral control. Gal-1 induces the expression of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and promotes adult neural stem cells proliferation, biological events impaired in stress-related psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety. Despite that, there is no evidence regarding galectin involvement in emotional control during stressful situations. Thus, we analyzed the behavioral phenotype of Gal-1 or Gal-3 knock-out mice (Gal-1 KO or Gal-3 KO) in different experimental models predictive of depressive and compulsive-like behaviors.
