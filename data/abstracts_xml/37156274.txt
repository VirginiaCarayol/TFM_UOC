Eucommiae cortex polysaccharides attenuate gut microbiota dysbiosis and neuroinflammation in mice exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress: Beneficial in ameliorating depressive-like behaviors.
Chronic stress alters gut microbiota composition, as well as induces inflammatory responses and behavioral deficits. Eucommiae cortex polysaccharides (EPs) have been reported to remodel gut microbiota and ameliorate obesogenic diet-induced systemic low-grade inflammation, but their role in stress-induced behavioral and physiological changes is poorly understood.
