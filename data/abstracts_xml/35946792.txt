Maternal separation affects anxiety-like behavior beginning in adolescence and continuing through adulthood and related to Dnmt3a expression.
Early life stress, including maternal separation, is among one of the main causes of anxiety in adolescents. DNA methyltransferase 3A (Dnmt3a) is a key molecule that regulates DNA methylation and is found to be associated with anxiety-like behavior. It is not clear whether maternal separation affects anxiety levels in mice at different developmental stages or whether Dnmt3a plays a role in this process. Here, by using the open field test to explore the effect of maternal separation on anxiety-like behavior in mice of different ages, it was found that maternal separation could successfully induce anxiety-like behavior in adolescent mice, which continued through adulthood. By using Western blot, we found that the levels of Dnmt3a in the hippocampus and cortex showed different trends in maternal separation mice on postnatal day (P)17. Furthermore, by using immunostaining, we found that the expression levels of Dnmt3a in the cortex and hippocampus were significantly different and decreased to varying degrees with the age of mice, which was the reason for different trends. Our results provide an experimental basis for further development of anxiety/depression treatment programs more suitable for adolescence.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Most anxiety disorders begin in adolescence and continue through adulthood, and research on adolescent anxiety's pathogenesis and treatment options is insufficient. In this research, our results show that maternal separation can successfully induce anxiety-like behavior in adolescent mice that continues through adulthood, further accompanied by abnormal expression of Dnmt3a, which provides an experimental basis for further development of anxiety/depression treatment programs more suitable for adolescence.
