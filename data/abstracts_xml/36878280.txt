Dulaglutide impedes depressive-like behavior persuaded by chronic social defeat stress model in male C57BL/6 mice: Implications on GLP-1R and cAMP/PKA signaling pathway in the hippocampus.
There is a well-founded relation between bullying and depression, which may eventually lead to suicidal behavior. Repurposing of antidiabetic drugs for the treatment of depression started to glow, which open new horizons to introduce the antidiabetic medications as new treatment picks in depression. Dulaglutide has been approved as remedy of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Consequently, our scope of work is to investigate the ability of dulaglutide to indulgence depression via deeply reconnoitering the Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor and cAMP/PKA Signaling Pathway.
