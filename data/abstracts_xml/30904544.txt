Reversal effect of Riparin IV in depression and anxiety caused by corticosterone chronic administration in mice.
Mental disorders have a multifactorial etiology and stress presents as one of the causal factors. In depression, it is suggested that high cortisol concentration contributes directly to the pathology of this disease. Based on that, the study aims to evaluate the potential antidepressant effect of Riparin IV (Rip IV) in mice submitted to chronic stress model by repeated corticosterone administration. Female Swiss mice were selected into four groups: control (Ctrl), corticosterone (Cort), Riparin IV (Cort + Rip IV) and fluvoxamine (Cort + Flu). Three groups were administrated subcutaneously (SC) with corticosterone (20 mg/kg) during twenty-one days, while the control group received only vehicle. After the fourteenth day, groups were administrated tested drugs: Riparin IV, fluvoxamine or distilled water, by gavage, 1 h after subcutaneous injections. After the final treatment, animals were exposed to behavioral models such as forced swimming test (FST), tail suspension test (TST), open field test (OFT), elevated plus maze (EPM) and sucrose preference test (SPT). The hippocampus was also removed for the determination of BDNF levels. Corticosterone treatment altered all parameters in behavioral tests, leading to a depressive- and anxious-like behavior. Riparin IV and fluvoxamine exhibit antidepressant effect in FST, TST and SPT. In EPM and OFT, treatment displayed anxiolytic effect without alteration of locomotor activity. Corticosterone administration decreased BDNF levels and Riparin IV could reestablish them, indicating that its antidepressant effect may be related to ability to ameliorate hippocampal neurogenesis. These findings suggest that Riparin IV improves the depressive and anxious symptoms after chronic stress and could be a new alternative treatment for patients with depression.
