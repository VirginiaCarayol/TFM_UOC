Inhibition of xCT by sulfasalazine alleviates the depression-like behavior of adult male mice subjected to maternal separation stress.
Maternal separation (MS) can induce emotional disorders. Our previous study reported that MS resulted in depression-like behavior. In this study, we aimed to explore the role of xCT in depression-like behavior in adult mice subjected to MS stress. Pups were divided into the control group, the control + sulfasalazine (SSZ, 75 mg/kg/day, i.p.) group, the MS group, and the MS+SSZ group. After MS, all pups were raised until PD60. Then, the depression-like behavior was detected by the novelty suppressed feeding (NSF) test, the forced swimming test (FST), and the tail suspension test (TST). The synaptic plasticity was examined by electrophysiological recordings and molecular biotechnology. The data showed that, compared with the control group, the mice in the MS group presented depression-like behavior, impairment of long-term potentiation (LTP), a reduction in the number of astrocytes, and activation of the microglia. Moreover, the expression of xCT was increased in the prefrontal cortex of MS mice, the EAAT2 and the Group Ⅱ metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR2/3) were decreased, and the level of pro-inflammatory factors was increased in the prefrontal cortex. After the administration with SSZ, the depression-like behavior and the impairment of LTP were alleviated, the number of astrocytes was increased, and the microglial activation was inhibited. Moreover, the levels of EAAT2 and mGluR2/3 were ameliorated, the over-activation of the microglia was mitigated, and the levels of glutamate and pro-inflammatory factors were decreased. In conclusion, the inhibition of xCT by SSZ could alleviate depression-like behavior partly via modulating the homeostasis of the glutamate system and dampening neuroinflammation.
