Sex differences in peripheral monoamine transmitter and related hormone levels in chronic stress mice with a depression-like phenotype.
Chronic stress could induce depression-like phenotype in animal models. Previous data showed that sex differences exist after chronic stress model establishment, however, the detailed information about the difference of blood biochemical indexes is not clear. In this study, we aim to supply comparison of monoamine transmitters and related hormone markers in serum between male and female depressed mice, and in order to better understand the sex difference in transmitters and hormone levels in depression occurrence and development.
