Repeated Collection of Vaginal Smear Causes Stress in Mice.
Women are more likely to be misdiagnosed in many neuropsychiatric disorders than men. One of the possible underlying reasons for this disparity may be more frequent use of male mice than female mice in neuroscience studies. With the increasing realization of the shortcomings of this approach in understanding the neurobiological basis of these disorders, many funding agencies mandate the inclusion of both male and female subjects in study design. As the behaviors vary with the stage of the estrous cycle, the collection of vaginal smears to identify the estrous stage becomes a widely used procedure. Here we tested whether vaginal smear collection causes similar effects to that of stress by evaluating an increase in depression-like behavior and impairment in memory.
