The neuroprotective effect of schisandrol A on 6-OHDA-induced PD mice may be related to PI3K/AKT and IKK/IκBα/NF-κB pathway.
Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Its main pathological feature is the substantial nigra-striatum dopaminergic neuronal dysfunction, which causes insufficient release of DA, induces motor symptoms, and is accompanied by nonmotor symptoms. Schisandrol A belongs to lignan components and has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and neuroprotective effects. In this experiment, we injected 6-OHDA into medial forebrain bundle of C57BL/6J male mice to establish the model. The motor function of mice was examined by open field test and pole test, the depression-like behavior of mice was examined by sucrose preference test and the memory function was examined by Y maze. We found that schisandrol A (20 mg/kg/d) could significantly improve the motor symptoms, and alleviate the depression-like symptoms and memory dysfunction of PD mice induced by 6-OHDA. Then we studied the neuroprotective mechanism of schisandrol A by H.E., ELISA assay kits and Western blot. Results showed that schisandrol A may enhance the PI3K/AKT pathway, inhibit the IKK/IκBα/NF-κB pathway, reduce neuronal inflammation and oxidative stress, and enhance the survival of DA neurons in the brain of mice. These results indicate that schisandrol A is expected to be a potential drug for improving Parkinson's disease.
