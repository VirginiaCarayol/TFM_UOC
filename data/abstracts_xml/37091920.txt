Electroacupuncture treatment ameliorates depressive-like behavior and cognitive dysfunction via CB1R dependent mitochondria biogenesis after experimental global cerebral ischemic stroke.
This study aimed to identify the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) treatment on post-stroke depression (PSD) and explore whether cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R)-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis accounts for the treatment effect of EA.
