Blunted 5-HT1A receptor-mediated responses and antidepressant-like behavior in mice lacking the GABAB1a but not GABAB1b subunit isoforms.
There is accumulating evidence for a role of GABAB receptors in depression. GABAB receptors are heterodimers of GABAB1 and GABAB2 receptor subunits. The predominant GABAB1 subunit isoforms are GABAB1a and GABAB1b. GABAB1 isoforms in mice differentially influence cognition, conditioned fear, and susceptibility to stress, yet their influence in tests of antidepressant-like activity has not been fully investigated.
