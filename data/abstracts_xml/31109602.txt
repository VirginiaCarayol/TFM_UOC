3-(4-Chlorophenylselanyl)-1-methyl-1H-indole promotes recovery of neuropathic pain and depressive-like behavior induced by partial constriction of the sciatic nerve in mice.
3-(4-Chlorophenylselanyl)-1-methyl-1H-indole (CMI) is an organoselenium compound that presents antioxidant activity, antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory and antidepressive-like effect in mice in previous studies conducted by our research group. In this study, we evaluate the anti-allodynic, anti-hyperalgesic and antidepressant-like effects of CMI on partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSNL) in male adult Swiss mice (25-35 g) as well as the involvement of oxidative stress in these effects. Mice underwent PSNL surgery and after 4 weeks they were treated with CMI (10 mg/kg, intragastric route [i.g.]) or vehicle. The treatment with CMI (10 mg/kg, i.g.) reversed the increased the percentage of response to Von-Frey Hair (VFH) stimulation, decreased the latency time to nociceptive response in the hot-plate test, increased immobility time in the forced swimming test (FST) and decreased groomings activity in the splash test, all induced by PSNL. Additionally, CMI also reversed increased the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation in cortex and hippocampus and plasmatic levels of corticosterone in mice, induced by PSNL. Results demonstrate that CMI reversed behavioral and biochemical alterations in the dyad pain-depression induced by PSNL and possibly modulation of oxidative system.
