Effect of M2 Macrophage-Derived Soluble Factors on Behavioral Patterns and Cytokine Production in Various Brain Structures in Depression-Like Mice.
We studied the effect of soluble factors derived from human macrophages polarized to M2 phenotype under conditions of serum deprivation (M2-SF) on behavioral pattern and cytokine production in various brain structures in mice with modeled stress-induced depression. Intranasal administration of M2-SF for 7 days led to stimulation of locomotor and exploratory activities and a decrease in emotional reactivity in the open-field test as well as reduction in depression-like behavior in Porsolt forced swimming test and a decrease in anxiety and anhedonia. Correction of depression-like behavior was accompanied by down-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, and IFNγ) in pathogenetically important brain structures (striatum, hippocampus, and frontal cortex). These data indicate that the antidepressant potential of M2 type macrophages can be mediated by the anti-inflammatory effects of M2-SF.
