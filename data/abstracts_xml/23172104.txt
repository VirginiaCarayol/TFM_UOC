Imbalance between Th17 and Treg cells may play an important role in the development of chronic unpredictable mild stress-induced depression in mice.
Recent data suggest that major depression is potentially associated with dysregulated cytokine production. However, the roles of T helper (Th) cells and their subsets in the development of depression still remain to be determined. The present study assessed changes in Th cell subsets and cytokines during the development of depression in a mouse model.
