Antidepressant-like effects of the novel kappa opioid antagonist MCL-144B in the forced-swim test.
Previous studies have demonstrated that kappa opioid receptor (KOR) antagonists reduce stress- and depression-like behaviors. We hypothesized that administration of a novel opioid mixed agonist/antagonist capable of antagonist activity at the KOR would attenuate forced-swim stress (FSS)-induced immobility, an animal model of depression-like behavior. C57Bl/6J mice were exposed to antinociceptive and repeated FSS testing after pretreatment with a graded dose of a novel bivalent morphinan compound, bis(N-cyclobutylmethylmorphinan-3-yl) sebacoylate dihydrochloride (MCL-144B). MCL-144B demonstrated dose- and time-dependent antinociception and KOR-mediated antagonism. In support of the hypothesis, pretreatment with MCL-144B dose-dependently attenuated stress-induced antinociception and immobility in the forced-swim test.
