Saikosaponin a activates tet1/dll3/notch1 signalling and promotes hippocampal neurogenesis to improve depression-like behavior in mice.
Radix Bupleuri, also named "Chaihu" in Chinese, is a substance derived from the dry roots of Bupleurum chinense DC. [Apiaceae] and Bupleurum scorzonerifolium Willd. [Apiaceae]. Radix Bupleuri was initially recorded as a medicinal herb in Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing, the earliest monograph concerning traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Ever since, Radix Bupleuri has been broadly used to alleviate exterior syndrome, disperse heat, modulate the liver-qi, and elevate yang-qi in TCM. Radix Bupleuri has also been utilized as an important component in Xiaoyaosan, a classical formula for relieving depression, which was originated from the famous Chinese medical book called "Tai Ping Hui Min He Ji Ju Fang" in Song Dynasty. Currently, many valuable pharmacological effects of Radix Bupleuri have been explored, such as antidepressant, neuroprotective activities, antiinflammation, anticancer, immunoregulation, etc. Former studies have illustrated that Saikosaponin A (SSa), one of the primary active components of Radix Bupleuri, possesses potential antidepressant properties. However, the underlying mechanisms still remain unknown.
