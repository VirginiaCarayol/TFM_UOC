Effect of (4a) a novel 5-HT3 receptor antagonist on chronic unpredictable mild stress induced depressive-like behavior in mice: an approach using behavioral tests battery.
The inconsistent therapeutic outcome necessitates designing and identifying novel therapeutic interventions for depression. Hence, the present study deals with the investigation of antidepressant-like effects of a novel 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (4-phenylpiperazin-1-yl) (quinoxalin-2-yl) methanone (4a) on chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) induced behavioral and biochemical alterations.
