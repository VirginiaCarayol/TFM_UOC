Comprehensive behavioral analysis of tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (Tdo2) knockout mice.
Tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO2) is an initial rate-limiting enzyme of the kynurenine (Kyn) pathway in tryptophan (Trp) metabolism. The Trp-degrading enzymes, TDO2 and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, are activated by stress and/or inflammation. Dysregulation of Trp metabolism, which causes shifts in the balance between Kyn and serotonin (5-HT) pathways, is associated with psychiatric and neurological disorders. In genetic studies, single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the TDO2 gene were shown to be involved in psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and depression. It has been reported that targeted deletion of the Tdo2 gene in mice resulted in reduced anxiety-like behavior, enhanced exploratory activity and cognitive performance, and increased levels of Trp and 5-HT in the hippocampus and midbrain. However, the effect of Tdo2 gene deletion on behavioral phenotypes has not yet been investigated extensively.
