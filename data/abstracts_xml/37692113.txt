Chronic unpredictable mild stress promotes atherosclerosis via adipose tissue dysfunction in ApoE-/- mice.
Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) has been shown to exacerbate atherosclerosis, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Adipose tissue is an energy storage organ and the largest endocrine organ in the human body, playing a key role in the development of cardiovascular disease. In this research, it was hypothesized that CUMS may exacerbate the development of atherosclerosis by inducing the hypertrophy and dysfunction of white adipocytes.
