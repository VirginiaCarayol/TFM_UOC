Splenectomy does not affect mouse behaviors.
The spleen is critical for immunity. It is the largest immune organ and immune center in the peripheral system. While the relationship between behavior and immunity has been demonstrated in physiology and diseases, the role of the spleen in behavior is not clear. To investigate the effects of the spleen on behaviors, we performed a refined splenectomy procedure on C57BL/6J mice and performed an open field test, circadian rhythm test, elevated plus maze, sucrose preference test, and Barnes maze test. Splenectomy did not induce changes in general locomotion, circadian rhythms, learning and memory, or depression/anxiety-related behaviors. To further investigate the effects of spleen on stress susceptibility, we established mouse models of depression through chronic unpredictable mild stress. The behavioral performances of mice subjected to splenectomy showed no differences from control animals. These findings suggest that splenectomy does not cause changes in baseline behavioral performance in mice.
