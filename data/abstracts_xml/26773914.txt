PTPRR regulates ERK dephosphorylation in depression mice model.
The Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type R (PTPRR), which regulates the dephosphorylation of the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) steering cell proliferation, apoptosis and synaptic plasticity, may be involved in the pathogenesis of depression.
