CircDYM ameliorates CUMS mice depressive-like behavior and inhibits hippocampal neurons injury via miR-497a-5p/NR3C1 axis.
Depression is an important mental disease that threatens human physical and mental health. Circular RNA (circRNA) has been confirmed to be involved in the regulation of depression progression, but the role and mechanism of circDYM in depression progression need to be further explored.
