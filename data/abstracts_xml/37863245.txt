5-HT1A Receptors on Dentate Gyrus Granule Cells Confer Stress Resilience.
Hyperactivity of granule cells in the ventral dentate gyrus (vDG) promotes vulnerability to chronic stress. However, which receptors in the vDG could be targeted to inhibit this hyperactivity and confer stress resilience is not known. The serotonin 1A receptor (5-HT1AR) is a Gi protein-coupled inhibitory receptor that has been implicated in stress adaptation, anxiety, depression, and antidepressant responses. 5-HT1ARs are highly expressed in the DG, but their potential to promote stress resilience by regulating granule cell activity has never been examined.
