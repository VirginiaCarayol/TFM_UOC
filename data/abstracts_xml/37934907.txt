Radioprotective effect of Ginkgolide B on brain: the mediating role of DCC/MST1 signaling.
The risk of brain exposure to ionizing radiation increases gradually due to the extensive application of nuclear technology in medical, industrial, and aerospace fields. Radiation-induced brain injury (RBI) is highly likely to cause a wide range of neurological complications, including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), depression. Ginkgolide B (GB) is one of the effective active components extracted from ginkgo biloba leaves, exerts protective effects on CNS, which is involved in the regulation of the Hippo signaling pathway. MST1, as one of the core kinases of the Hippo pathway, participated in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. However, it remains unclear whether GB attenuates radiation brain injury (RBI) and whether the radioprotective effect of GB refers to MST1 signaling. Hence, our study aimed to explore the radiation protection effect and the potential mechanism of GB.
