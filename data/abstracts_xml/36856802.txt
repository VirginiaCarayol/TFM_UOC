Intranasal administration of interleukin-4 ameliorates depression-like behavior and biochemical alterations in mouse submitted to the chronic unpredictable mild stress: modulation of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress.
Physical and psychological stress modulates the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, and the redox and inflammatory systems. Impairments in these systems have been extensively reported in major depression (MD) patients. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate the effects of the intranasal administration of interleukin-4 (IL-4) in mice with depressive-like behavior induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) for 28 days. On the 28th day, mice received IL-4 intranasally (1 ng/mouse) or vehicle (sterile saline), and after 30 min, they were submitted to behavioral tests or euthanasia for blood collection and removal of the adrenal glands, axillary lymph nodes, spleen, thymus, prefrontal cortices (PFC), and hippocampi (HC). A single administration of IL-4 reversed CUMS-induced depression-like behavior in the tail suspension test and splash test, without evoking locomotor changes. IL-4 administration reduced the plasma levels of corticosterone and the increased weight of suprarenal glands in stressed mice. Moreover, IL-4 restored the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), IL-4, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in the PFC and HC and modulated oxidative stress markers in these brain structures in stressed mice. Our results showed for the first time the antidepressant-like effect of IL-4 through the modulation of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. The potential effect of IL-4 administered intranasally arises as an innovative strategy for MD treatment.
