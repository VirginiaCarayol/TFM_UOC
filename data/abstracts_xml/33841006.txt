Korean Red Ginseng reduces chronic social defeat stress-induced mood disorders via N-methyl-D-aspartateÂ receptor modulation in mice.
A chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) model has been proposed as relevant to stress-induced behavioral change in humans. In this study, we examined the effect of Korean Red Ginseng (KRG) on CSDS-induced mood disorders and protein expression in an animal model.
