[Effects of shuyu ningxln recipe on the praxiology and the expressions of hippocampal BDNF and trkB of model rats with chronic stress-induced depression].
To observe the effects of Shuyu Ningxin Recipe (SNR) on the praxiology and the expressions of hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) of model rats with chronic stress-induced depression, thus exploring its anti-depression mechanisms.
