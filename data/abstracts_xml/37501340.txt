Presenilin-2 knock-In mice show severe depressive behavior via DVL3 downregulation.
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Depression is one of the most critical psychiatric complications of AD, and 20%-30% of patients with AD experience symptoms of depression. Phospho-glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3β) is known to be associated with AD and depression. Furthermore, the role of disheveled (DVL) is known to regulate GSK3β. Moreover, presenilin-2 (PS2) and DVL have cross-talk with each other. Also, it is widely hypothesized that stress leads to hypersecretion of cortisol and is thus associated with depression. Dickkopf WNT signaling pathway inhibitor-1 (DKK-1) is a crucial factor regulating depression and both amyloid beta (Aβ) and phosphorylation of tau are widely known as a biomarker of AD.
