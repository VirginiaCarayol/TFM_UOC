Blockade of NOP receptor modulates anxiety-related behaviors in mice exposed to inescapable stress.
Depression and anxiety frequently co-occur, and this has important clinical implications. Previous studies showed that activation of the nociceptin/orphanin FQ receptor (NOP) elicits anxiolytic effects, while its blockade promotes consistent antidepressant actions. NOP antagonists are effective in reversing footshock-induced depressive-like behaviors, but their effects on stress-induced anxiety are still unclear.
