Comprehensive behavioral analysis of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase knockout mice.
Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) metabolizes the essential amino acid tryptophan into kynurenine derivatives, which are involved in neural activity via the kynurenine pathway (KP). IDO1 is an initial rate-limiting enzyme in the KP and is activated by stress and/or inflammation. The perturbation of IDO1 activity, which causes KP imbalance, is associated with psychiatric and neurological disorders. It has been reported that wild-type (WT) mice under inflammatory conditions show increased anxiety-like behavior and decreased novel object recognition, whereas Ido1 knockout (KO) mice do not display these behaviors. However, the behavioral phenotypes of Ido1 KO mice have not yet been fully examined under non-inflammatory conditions.
