Palmatine ameliorates LPS-induced HT-22 cells and mouse models of depression by regulating apoptosis and oxidative stress.
Depression is one of the most common neuropsychiatric disorders that is characterized by low mood, lack of motivation, slow thinking, and recurrent suicidal thoughts. The mechanism of action of palmatine in depression has been rarely reported and remains unclear. The present study examined the neuroprotective effects of palmatine on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced oxidative stress, apoptosis, and depression-like behavior. In this study, cell apoptosis was evaluated by CCK-8, flow cytometry, and Hoechst 33258 staining in LPS-induced HT-22 cells. Meanwhile, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential were detected in vitro. In vivo, we investigated depressive-like behaviors in mice by an open field test (OFT) and elevated plus-maze test (EPM). Additionally, the levels of superoxide dismutases (SOD), TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The hematoxylin-eosin staining and TUNEL staining were used to evaluate the pathology of the hippocampus. The expression of Nrf2/HO-1 and BAX/Bcl-2 pathways in the hippocampus were assessed by Western blot analysis. Palmatine could significantly reduce apoptosis and ROS levels, and improve mitochondrial damage. Moreover, palmatine significantly improves movement time and central square crossing time in OFT, and improves open arms and movement time in EMP. And the levels of SOD, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 were significantly decreased after palmatine treatment. More importantly, palmatine improved neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus, and depression through BAX/Bcl-2 and Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathways. We provide evidence that palmatine further alleviates the depressive-like behavior of LPS-induced by improving apoptosis and oxidative stress.
