The selenium-containing compound 3-((4-chlorophenyl)selanyl)-1-methyl-1H-indole reverses depressive-like behavior induced by acute restraint stress in mice: modulation of oxido-nitrosative stress and inflammatory pathway.
Stress-induced alterations in oxidative and inflammatory parameters have been implicated in the pathophysiology of mood disorders. Based on the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of the selenium-containing compound 3-((4-chlorophenyl)selanyl)-1-methyl-1H-indole (CMI), we assessed its ability to reverse depression-like behavioral alterations, neuroinflammation, and oxidative imbalance induced by acute restraint stress.
