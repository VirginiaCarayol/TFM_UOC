Resolvin D2 attenuates chronic pain-induced depression-like behavior in mice.
We previously demonstrated that intracerebroventricular injection of resolvin D2 (RvD2), a bioactive lipid mediator derived from docosahexaenoic acid, ameliorated depression-like behavior in lipopolysaccharide-induced and chronic mild stress-induced mouse models of depression. In the present study, we examined the antidepressant effect of RvD2 on chronic pain-induced depression-like behavior.
