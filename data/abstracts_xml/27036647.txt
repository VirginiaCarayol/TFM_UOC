A novel isoquinoline compound abolishes chronic unpredictable mild stress-induced depressive-like behavior in mice.
Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) elicits aspects of cognitive and behavioral alterations that can be used to model comparable aspects of depression in humans. The aim of the present study was to investigate the antidepressant-like potential of 7-fluoro-1,3-diphenylisoquinoline-1-amine (FDPI), a novel isoquinoline compound, in CUMS, a model that meets face, construct and predictive criteria for validity. Swiss mice were subjected to different stress paradigms daily for a period of 35 days to induce the depressive-like behavior. The animals received concomitant FDPI (0.1 and 1mg/kg, intragastric) or paroxetine (8mg/kg, intraperitoneal) and CUMS. The behavioral tests (splash test, tail suspension test, modified forced swimming test and locomotor activity) were performed. The levels of cytokines, corticosterone and adrenocorticotropic (ACTH) hormones were determined in the mouse prefrontal cortex and serum. The synaptosomal [(3)H] serotonin (5-HT) uptake, nuclear factor (NF)-ÎºB, tyrosine kinase receptor (TrkB) and pro-brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels were determined in the mouse prefrontal cortex. CUMS induced a depressive-like behavior in mice, which was demonstrated in the modified forced swimming, tail suspension and splash tests. FDPI at both doses prevented depressive-like behavior induced by CUMS, without altering the locomotor activity of mice. FDPI at the highest dose prevented the increase in the levels of NF-kB, pro-inflammatory cytokines, corticosterone and ACTH and modulated [(3)H]5-HT uptake and the proBDNF/TrkB signaling pathway altered by CUMS. The present findings demonstrated that FDPI elicited an antidepressant-like effect in a model of stress-induced depression.
