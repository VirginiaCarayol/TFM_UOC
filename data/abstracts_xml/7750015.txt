[Application of fragrances to treatments for depression].
High pressure stress was found to induce immunosuppression accompanied with the enhancement of motor activity in mice. Citrus fragrance restored stress-induced immunosuppression and induced calm behavior in mice. In the forced swimming test using rats, citrus fragrance reduced the total immobility time and potentiated the imipramine-induced reduction in total immobility time. The application of citrus fragrance to depressive patients made it possible to markedly reduce the doses of antidepressants needed for the treatment of patients.
