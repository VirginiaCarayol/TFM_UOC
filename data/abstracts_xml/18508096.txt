Implication of neuropeptide-Y Y2 receptors in the effects of immune stress on emotional, locomotor and social behavior of mice.
Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is involved in the regulation of emotional behavior, and there is indirect evidence for a role of NPY in the cerebral responses to peripheral immune challenge. Since the NPY receptors involved in these reactions are not known, we investigated the effect of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on emotional, locomotor and social behavior, body temperature and circulating corticosterone in female Y2 (Y2-/-) and Y4 (Y4-/-) receptor knockout mice. LPS (0.1mg/kg injected IP 2.5h before testing) increased rectal temperature in control and Y4-/- mice to a larger degree than in Y2-/- animals. Both Y2-/- and Y4-/- mice exhibited reduced anxiety-related and depression-like behavior in the open field, elevated plus-maze and tail suspension test, respectively. While depression-like behavior was not changed by LPS, anxiety-related behavior was enhanced by LPS in Y2-/-, but not control and Y4-/- animals. Y2-/- mice were also particularly susceptible to the effect of LPS to attenuate locomotor behavior and social interaction with another mouse. The corticosterone response to LPS was blunted in Y2-/- mice which presented elevated levels of circulating corticosterone following vehicle treatment. These data show that Y2-/- mice are particularly sensitive to the effects of LPS-evoked immune stress to attenuate locomotion and social interaction and to increase anxiety-like behavior, while the LPS-induced rise of temperature and circulating corticosterone is suppressed by Y2 receptor knockout. Our observations attest to an important role of endogenous NPY acting via Y2 receptors in the cerebral response to peripheral immune challenge.
