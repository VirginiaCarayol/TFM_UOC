Musclin prevents depression-like behavior in male mice by activating urocortin 2 signaling in the hypothalamus.
Physical activity is recommended as an alternative treatment for depression. Myokines, which are secreted from skeletal muscles during physical activity, play an important role in the skeletal muscle-brain axis. Musclin, a newly discovered myokine, exerts physical endurance, however, the effects of musclin on emotional behaviors, such as depression, have not been evaluated. This study aimed to access the anti-depressive effect of musclin and clarify the connection between depression-like behavior and hypothalamic neuropeptides in mice.
