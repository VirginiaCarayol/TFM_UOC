Microglial stimulation triggered by intranasal lipopolysaccharide administration produces antidepressant-like effect through ERK1/2-mediated BDNF synthesis in the hippocampus.
We recently reported that reversing the chronic stress-induced decline of microglia in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus by intraperitoneal injection of a low dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) ameliorated depression-like behavior in chronically stressed mice. In this study, we found that a single intranasal administration of LPS dose-dependently improved depression-like behavior in mice treated with chronic unpredictable stress (CUS), as evidenced by the reduction of immobility time in the tail suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test (FST) and by the increase of sucrose uptake in the sucrose preference test (SPT). The antidepressant effects of intranasal administration of LPS could be abolished by inhibition of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling by infusion of an anti-BDNF antibody, by knock-in of the mutant BDNF Val68Met allele, or by the BDNF receptor antagonist K252a. In addition, intranasal administration of LPS was found to exert antidepressant effects in a BDNF-dependent manner via promotion of BDNF synthesis mediated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling but not protein kinase B (Akt)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in DG. Inhibition of microglia by minocycline or depletion of microglia by PLX3397 was able to abolish the reversal effect of intranasal LPS administration on CUS-induced depression-like behaviors as well as the CUS-induced decrease in phospho-ERK1/2 and BDNF protein levels in DG. These results demonstrate that stimulation of hippocampal microglia by intranasal LPS administration can induce antidepressant effects via ERK1/2-dependent synthesis of BDNF protein, providing hope for the development of new strategies for the treatment of depression.
