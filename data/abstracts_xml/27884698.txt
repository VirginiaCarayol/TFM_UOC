Alteration of the brain morphology and the response to the acute stress in the recombinant mouse lines with different predisposition to catalepsy.
Catalepsy is an inability to correct an externally imposed awkward posture; it is associated with schizophrenia and depression in human. We created new recombinant B6.CBA-D13Mit76C and B6.CBA-D13Mit76B mouse lines on the C57Bl/6 genome, carrying the 102.73-110.56Mbp fragment of chromosome 13 derived from the catalepsy-prone CBA strain and catalepsy-resistant C57BL/6 strain, respectively. We compared the behavior and brain morphology (11.7T BioSpec 117/16 USR tomograph, Germany) in these lines. The effects of acute emotional stress on corticosterone's level in the blood and mRNA expression of Bdnf and Arc genes in the brain were investigated. The B6.CBA-D13Mit76B mice were non-cataleptic, while about 17% of B6.CBA-D13Mit76C mice demonstrated catalepsy-like immobility. No difference between these lines was revealed in the open field and social interaction tests. In the Morris water maze test, both lines effectively found the platform on the fourth day; however B6.CBA-D13Mit76B mice achieved significantly better results than cataleptic-prone animals. B6.CBA-D13Mit76C mice were characterized by decreased volume of the total brain and reduced sizes of striatum, cerebellum and pituitary gland. The both lines showed the similar basal and stress-induced levels of corticosterone, while the brain expression of Bdnf and Arc genes was more vulnerable to stress in the catalepsy-prone B6.CBA-D13Mit76C line.
