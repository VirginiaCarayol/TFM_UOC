Periaqueductal gray is required for controlling chronic stress-induced depression-like behavior.
Enduring exposure to psychological stress is associated with an elevated risk of major depressive disorder (MDD). There is an enormous need to investigate the unexplored mechanisms of MDD. We examined whether pain-free stress alters synaptic transmission, causing depression-like behaviors in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG), a brain stem nucleus that controls stress-related depression-like behavior.
