Therapeutic and Preventive Effect of Voluntary Running Wheel Exercise on Social Defeat Stress (SDS)-induced Depressive-like Behavior and Chronic Pain in Mice.
Major depressive disorders (MDD) and chronic pain (CP) affect significant portion of the world's population and have high comorbidity rate. Social defeat stress (SDS) model was standardized in mice and can trigger depressive-like behavior and chronic pain. Based especially on clinical trials showing an effective preventive and therapeutic effect of physical exercise on CP and symptoms associated with MDD, this study aimed to investigate if the voluntary running wheel exercise can exert these effects in mice submitted to the 10-day SDS protocol, using fluoxetine as positive control. For this, we ran two set of experiments: in the first set mice started performing voluntary running wheel exercise after submitted to SDS and, in the second set, mice performed voluntary running wheel exercise before and during SDS. Mechanical and chemical hyperalgesia was analyzed through electronic von Frey and capsaicin test, respectively. Depressive-like behavior was assessed through social interaction test. Our results showed that the voluntary running wheel exercise was more effective than fluoxetine reversing the SDS-induced persistent hyperalgesia and both, fluoxetine and voluntary running wheel exercise, was effective reversing SDS-induced social avoidance. Also, voluntary running wheel exercise is an effective tool preventing both hyperalgesia and social avoidance induced by SDS. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first study using physical exercise as a therapeutic and preventive tool for chronic pain and depressive-like behavior simultaneously induced by social stress.
