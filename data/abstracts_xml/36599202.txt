Disruption of IDO signaling pathway alleviates chronic unpredictable mild stress-induced depression-like behaviors and tumor progression in mice with breast cancer.
Women with breast cancer (BC) are often combined with psychological disorder such as depression and anxiety. Depression is associated or correlated with increased toxicity and severity of physical symptoms. However, the mechanism of BC progression related to the regulation of emotion-related circuitry remains to be further explored. The study aims to investigate indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) pathway mechanism underlying stress-induced progression of BC. BC cell line 4T1 was subcutaneously inoculated into BALB/c mice, and they then received daily chronic unpredictable mild stressors (CUMS) for 12Â weeks. Depression-like behavior tests were conducted, including sucrose preference test (SPT), tail suspension test (TST), forced swimming test (FST), and novelty suppressed feeding test (NSF). The levels of 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and inflammatory factors, IL-6, CXCL1, IL-10 and IL-4 were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of mouse serum. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to detect Ki67- or FOXP3-positive tumor cells. The status of IDO signaling pathway was assessed by immunoblotting analysis. CUMS induced depression-like behaviors, decreased the level of 5-HT, promoted tumor progression, enhanced the immunohistochemical staining of Ki-67, and promoted the activation of IDO signaling pathway in BC mice. The IDO signaling pathway was disrupted in mice by lentiviral transduction of shRAN-IDO. Lentivirus-mediated IDO knockdown attenuated CUMS-induced depression-like behaviors, increased the level of 5-HT, inhibited tumor progression, and reduced the immunohistochemical staining of Ki-67 in BC mice. The present study suggests that disruption of IDO signaling pathway alleviates CUMS-induced depression-like behaviors and inhibits tumor progression in BC mice.
