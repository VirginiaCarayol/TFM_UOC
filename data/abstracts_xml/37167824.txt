Pulsatilla chinensis saponins ameliorated murine depression by inhibiting intestinal inflammation mediated IDO1 overexpression and rebalancing tryptophan metabolism.

Emerging evidence suggested that depression is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), intestinal inflammation is an increasingly accepted factor that influences depression, but the mechanism is unclear.
