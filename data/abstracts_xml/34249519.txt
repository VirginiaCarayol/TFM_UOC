CGRP overexpression does not alter depression-like behavior in mice.
The calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a neuropeptide that is released from capsaicin-sensitive nerves as a potent vasodilator involved in nociceptive transmission. While CGRP has been rigorously studied for its role in migraines owing to its vasodilation and inflammation activities, the effects of CGRP overexpression on depressive-like behaviors remain insufficiently understood.
