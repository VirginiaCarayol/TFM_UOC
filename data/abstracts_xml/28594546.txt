Neuropeptide VGF C-Terminal Peptide TLQP-62 Alleviates Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Memory Deficits and Anxiety-like and Depression-like Behaviors in Mice: The Role of BDNF/TrkB Signaling.
Peripheral inflammatory responses affect central nervous system (CNS) function, manifesting in symptoms of memory deficits, depression, and anxiety. Previous studies have revealed that neuropeptide VGF (nonacronymic) C-terminal peptide TLQP-62 rapidly reinforces brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) signaling, regulating memory consolidation and antidepressant-like action. However, whether it is beneficial for lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuropsychiatric dysfunction in mice is unknown. Herein, we explored the involvement of BDNF/TrkB signaling and biochemical alterations in inflammatory or oxidative stress markers in the alleviating effects of TLQP-62 on LPS-induced neuropsychiatric dysfunction. The mice were treated with TLQP-62 (2 Î¼g/side) via intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection 1 h before LPS (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) administration. Our results showed that a single treatment with LPS (0.5 mg/kg, i.p) is sufficient to produce recognition memory deficits (in the novel object recognition test), depression-like behavior (in the forced swim test and sucrose preference test), and anxiety-like behavior (in the elevated zero maze). However, pretreatment with TLQP-62 prevented LPS-induced behavioral dysfunction, neuroinflammatory, and oxidative responses. In addition, our results further demonstrated that a reduction in BDNF expression mediated by BDNF-shRNA lentivirus significantly blocked the effects of TLQP-62, suggesting the critical role of BDNF/TrkB signaling in the neuroprotective effects of TLQP-62 in the mice. In conclusion, TLQP-62 could be a therapeutic approach for neuropsychiatric disorders, which are closely associated with neuroinflammation and oxidative stress.
