Depression-like behavior, hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation presented in diabetic mice are reversed by the administration of 1-methyl-3-(phenylselanyl)-1H-indole.
Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are found both in diabetes mellitus and major depressive disorder (MDD). In addition to damage in peripheral organs, such as liver and kidney, diabetic patients have a higher risk of developing depression. In this sense, the objective of the present study was to characterize the antidepressant-like effect of a selenium-containing compound, the 1-methyl-3-(phenylselanyl)-1H-indole (MFSeI), in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. STZ (200 mg/kg, i.p.) was used to induce diabetes mellitus type I, and after seven days, the administration of MFSeI (10 mg/kg, i.g.) was initiated and followed for the next 14 days. Twenty-four hours after the last administration of MFSeI, the behavioral tests were performed, followed by euthanasia. The treatment with MFSeI was able to reverse the hyperglycemia induced by STZ. MFSeI also decreased the plasma levels of biomarkers of liver and kidney damage. Importantly, MFSeI reversed the depression-like behavior induced by STZ in the tail suspension test and forced swimming test without promoting locomotor alterations. Furthermore, MFSeI reversed the increased levels of reactive species and lipid peroxidation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus (HC), liver, and kidney of STZ-treated mice. Treatment with MFSeI also decreased the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, inducible nitric oxide synthase and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, while increasing the expression of interleukin-10, insulin receptor substrate-1 and glucose transport-4 in the PFC and HC of mice. Taken together, the results indicate the effectiveness of MFSeI against depression-like behavior and central and peripheral complications caused by diabetes in mice.
