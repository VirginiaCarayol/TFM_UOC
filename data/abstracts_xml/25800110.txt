The effects of apigenin on lipopolysaccharide-induced depressive-like behavior in mice.
Increasing evidence shows that inflammation may contribute to the pathophysiology of depression. Apigenin, one type of natural flavone, has a number of biological actions including anti-inflammatory effects. Although it has potential antidepressant activity in a chronic mild stress model, the mechanisms of antidepressant effect for apigenin remain unclear. Here, we examined the effects of apigenin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depressive-like behavior in male mice. A single administration of LPS (0.5mg/kg, i.p.) increased the immobility time in the tail suspension test (TST) and reduced sucrose preference without changing spontaneous locomotor activity in open field test (OFT). Pre-treatment with apigenin (25, 50mg/kg, i.p.) or fluoxetine (positive control drug, 20mg/kg, i.p.) once daily for 7 consecutive days prevented the abnormal behavior induced by LPS. Apigenin or fluoxetine also effectively attenuated LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β (interleukin-1β) and TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor-α). Moreover, apigenin or fluoxetine significantly suppressed the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression at both the mRNA and protein level via the modulation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation in the prefrontal cortex. Additionally, apigenin (50mg/kg, i.p.) or fluoxetine (20mg/kg, i.p.) effectively reversed the depressive-like behavior induced by TNF-α (0.1fg/site, i.c.v.) without altering the locomotor activity. These results demonstrate that apigenin exhibits antidepressant-like effects in LPS treated mice, partially due to its anti-inflammatory properties.
