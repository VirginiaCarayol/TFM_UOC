miR-124 Exacerbates depressive-like behavior by targeting Ezh2 to induce autophagy.
On the basis of our previous research, miR-124 and autophagy have been shown to be associated with depression and antidepressant treatment, respectively. However, whether miR-124 is involved in depressive-like behavior and antidepressant efficacy through regulating autophagy remains poorly understood. The chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) depression model in mice was established, and then intraperitoneal fluoxetine injections (10 mg/kg) were administered for a duration of 4 weeks. The behavioral changes induced by CUMS were evaluated by the tail suspension test, open field test, sucrose preference test, and elevated plus maze test. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to detect expression levels of miR-124 and its three precursor genes in hippocampus of mice. Western blotting was used to detect the expressions of Ezh2 and autophagy proteins (P62, Atg3, Atg7, LC3-I, and LC3- II) in hippocampus of mice. Depression-like behaviors were successfully induced in CUMS models and reversed by SSRI treatments. The expression levels of miR-124 and its precursor gene ( miR-124-3 ) were significantly increased in the hippocampus of CUMS mice, while the expression levels were significantly decreased after 4 weeks of fluoxetine treatment. The mRNA and protein expressions of Ezh2, a validated target of miR-124, were decreased in the hippocampus of CUMS mice, and the fluoxetine treatment could reverse the expressions. A correlation analysis suggested that miR-124 had a significant negative correlation with Ezh2 mRNA expression. The protein levels of LC3-II/I, P62, and Atg7, which were found to be regulated by Ezh2, were increased in the hippocampus of CUMS mice and decreased after fluoxetine treatment. We speculated that autophagy was enhanced in the CUMS model of depression and might be mediated by miR-124 targeting Ezh2.
