Emotional-Single Prolonged Stress: A promising model to illustrate the gut-brain interaction.
Excessive stress can precipitate depression and anxiety diseases, and damage gastrointestinal functionality and microbiota changes, favoring the development of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) - defined by dysregulation in the brain-gut interaction. Therefore, the present study investigated if Emotional-Single Prolonged Stress (E-SPS) induces depressive/anxiety-like phenotype and gut dysfunction in adult Swiss male mice. For this, mice of the E-SPS group were subjected to three stressors sequential exposure: immobilization, swimming, and odor of the predator for 7 days (incubation period). Next, animals performed behavior tests and 24Â h later, samples of feces, blood, and colon tissue were collected. E-SPS increased the plasma corticosterone levels, immobility time in the tail suspension and forced swim test, decreased the grooming time in the splash test, OAT%, and OAE% in the elevated plus-maze test, as well as increased anxiety index. Mice of E-SPS had increased % of intestinal transit rate, % of fecal moisture content, and fecal pellets number, and decreased Claudin1 content in the colon. E-SPS decreased the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes phylum, Bacteroidia class, Bacteroidales order, Muribaculaceae and Porphyromonadaceae family, Muribaculum, and Duncaniella genus. However, E-SPS increased Firmicutes and Actinobacteria phylum, Coriobacteriales order, and the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes, and demonstrated Mucispirillum genus presence. The present study showed that E-SPS induced depressive/anxiety-like phenotype, predominant diarrhea gut dysfunction, and modulated the gut bacterial microbiota profile in male adult Swiss mice. E-SPS might be a promising model for future studies on the brain-gut interaction and the development of FGIDs with psychological comorbidities.
