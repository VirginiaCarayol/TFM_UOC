Convergence of Clinically Relevant Manipulations on Dopamine-Regulated Prefrontal Activity Underlying Stress Coping Responses.
Depression is pleiotropic and influenced by diverse genetic, environmental, and pharmacological factors. Identifying patterns of circuit activity on which many of these factors converge would be important, because studying these patterns could reveal underlying pathophysiological processes and/or novel therapies. Depression is commonly assumed to involve changes within prefrontal circuits, and dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) agonists are increasingly used as adjunctive antidepressants. Nevertheless, how D2Rs influence disease-relevant patterns of prefrontal circuit activity remains unknown.
