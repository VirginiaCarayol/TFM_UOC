P2X7 receptor-mediated depression-like reactions arising in the mouse medial prefrontal cortex.
Major depressive disorder is a frequent and debilitating psychiatric disease. We have shown in some of the acute animal models of major depressive disorder (tail suspension test and forced swim test) that depression-like behavior can be aggravated in mice by the microinjection into the medial prefrontal cortex of the P2X7R agonistic adenosine 5'-triphosphate or its structural analog dibenzoyl-ATP, and these effects can be reversed by the P2X7R antagonistic JNJ-47965567. When measuring tail suspension test, the prolongation of immobility time by the P2YR agonist adenosine 5'-[β-thio]diphosphate and the reduction of the adenosine 5'-(γ-thio)triphosphate effect by P2Y1R (MRS 2179) or P2Y12R (PSB 0739) antagonists, but not by JNJ-47965567, all suggest the involvement of P2YRs. In order to elucidate the localization of the modulatory P2X7Rs in the brain, we recorded current responses to dibenzoyl-ATP in layer V astrocytes and pyramidal neurons of medial prefrontal cortex brain slices by the whole-cell patch-clamp procedure; the current amplitudes were not altered in preparations taken from tail suspension test or foot shock-treated mice. The release of adenosine 5'-triphosphate was decreased by foot shock, although not by tail suspension test both in the hippocampus and PFC. In conclusion, we suggest, that in the medial prefrontal cortex, acute stressful stimuli cause supersensitivity of P2X7Rs facilitating the learned helplessness reaction.
