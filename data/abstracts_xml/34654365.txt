D-Serine produces antidepressant-like effects in mice through suppression of BDNF signaling pathway and regulation of synaptic adaptations in the nucleus accumbens.
D-Serine is a crucial endogenous co-agonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in the central nervous system and can affect the function of the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) system, which plays an essential role in modulating synaptic plasticity. The current study aimed to systematically evaluate the role and mechanisms of D-serine in depressive behavior in nucleus accumbens (NAc).
