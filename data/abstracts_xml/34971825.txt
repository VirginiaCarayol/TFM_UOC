Stress while lacking of control induces ventral hippocampal autophagic flux hyperactivity and a depression-like behavior.
Stressed animals may perform depression-like behavior insomuch as stress-provoking blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, central immune activation, and autophagic flux changes. This study was undertaken to assess whether adult mice having (executive) vs. lacking (yoke) of behavioral control in otherwise equivalent stress magnitude condition, may display differences in their BBB integrity, ventral hippocampal (VH) interleukin-6 (IL-6) and autophagic flux level and VH-related depression-like behavior. To further understand the causative relation of enhanced autophagic flux and stress-primed depression-like behavior, we assessed the effects of bilateral intra-VH 3-methyladenine (3-MA), an autophagic flux inhibitor, infusion in stressed mice.
