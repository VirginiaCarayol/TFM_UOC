Antidepressant-like effects of solidagenone on mice with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depression.
Considering the pharmacological potential of solidagenone from Solidago chilensis, the present investigation was carried out to evaluate its antidepressant-like effect in mice with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depressive like behavior and its mode of action through the measurement of neuroinflammatory and oxidative markers.
