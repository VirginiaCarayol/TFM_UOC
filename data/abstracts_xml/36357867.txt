Involvement of kynurenine pathway between inflammation and glutamate in the underlying etiopathology of CUMS-induced depression mouse model.
Inflammation and glutamate (GLU) are widely thought to participate in the pathogenesis of depression, and current evidence suggests that the development of depression is associated with the activation of the kynurenine pathway (KP). However, the exact mechanism of KP among the inflammation, GLU and depression remain poorly understood. In this study, we examined the involvement of KP, inflammation and GLU in depressive phenotype induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) in C57B/6 J mice. Our results showed that CUMS caused depressive like-behavior in the sucrose preference test, tail suspension test and forced swimming test. From a molecular perspective, CUMS upregulated the peripheral and central inflammatory response and activated indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), the rate-limiting enzyme of KP, which converts tryptophan (TRP) into kynurenine (KYN). KYN is a precursor for QA in microglia, which could activate the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), increasing the GLU release, mirrored by increased IDO activity, quinolinic acid and GLU levels in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and serum. However, intervention with IDO inhibitor 1-methyl-DL-tryptophan (50 mg/kg/s.c.) and 1-methyl-L-tryptophan (15 mg/kg/i.p.) reversed the depressive-like behaviors and adjusted central and peripheral KP's metabolisms levels as well as GLU content, but the inflammation levels were not completely affected. These results provide certain evidence that KP may be a vital pathway mediated by IDO linking inflammation and glutamate, contributing to depression.
