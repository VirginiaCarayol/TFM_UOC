Behavioral alterations, brain oxidative stress, and elevated levels of corticosterone associated with a pressure injury model in male mice.
Sustained stress can cause physiological disruption in crucial systems like the endocrine, autonomic, and central nervous system. In general, skin damages are physical stress present in hospitalized patients. Also, these pressure injuries lead to pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the neurobiology of mood disorders. Here, we aimed to investigate the behavioral alterations, oxidative stress, and corticosterone levels in the brain areas of mice submitted to the model of pressure injury (PI).
