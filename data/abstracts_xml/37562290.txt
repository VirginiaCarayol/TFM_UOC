SIRT1/PARP-1/NLRP3 cascade as a potential target for niacin neuroprotective effect in lipopolysaccharide-induced depressive-like behavior in mice.
Depression is a serious mood disorder characterized by monoamines deficiency, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and cell death. Niacin (vitamin B3 or nicotinic acid, NA), a chief mediator of neuronal development and survival in the central nervous system, exerts neuroprotective effects in several experimental models.
