The protective effect of luteolin on the depression-related dry eye disorder through Sirt1/NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway.
Luteolin has been reported to exhibit therapeutic effect on depressive-like behaviors in mice. Nevertheless, the therapeutic effect of luteolin on the depression-related dry eye disorder remains inconclusive. In this study, C57 mice were subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress in a dry environment (relative humidity in the cage <40%). The behavioral test and phenol red cotton thread test were employed to select the mice with both dry eye and depression-like behavior. The mechanism of luteolin on depression-related dry eye disorder was assessed by the Sirt1 selective inhibitor EX-527. Luteolin alleviated depressive-like behaviors induced by CUMS, increased tear secretion and restored corneal defects in mice. The secretions of pro-inflammatory factors IL-1β, IL-6, IL-18 and TNF-α were decreased in hippocampi and corneal tissues by Luteolin treatment. Luteolin treatment up-regulated Sirt1 expression and down-regulated Ac-NF-κB, NLRP3, Ac-Caspase-1, GSDMD-N, Cleaved IL-1β, and Cleaved IL-18 expressions. In addition, the selective inhibition of Sirt1 could weaken the therapeutic effect of luteolin on depression-related dry eye disorder. The beneficial effect of luteolin through Sirt1/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway might be a therapeutic strategy for the depression-related dry eye disorder.
