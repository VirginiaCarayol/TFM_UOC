A terrified-sound stress causes cognitive impairment in female mice by impairing neuronal plasticity.
Stress is an important environmental factor affecting mental health that cannot be ignored. Moreover, due to the great physiological differences between males and females, the effects of stress may vary by sex. Previous studies have shown that terrified-sound stress, meaning exposed mice to the recorded vocalizations in response to the electric shock by their kind to induce psychological stress, can cause cognitive impairment in male. In the study, we investigated the effects of the terrified-sound stress on adult female mice.
