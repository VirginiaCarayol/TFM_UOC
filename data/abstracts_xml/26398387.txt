Partial effects of the AMPAkine CX717 in a strain specific battery of tests for manic-like behavior in black Swiss mice.
AMPA receptors are highly expressed throughout the central nervous system and are suggested to be involved in mood regulation. Studies found changes in glutamate, its metabolites and receptors in patients with bipolar disorder (BPD) or major depression (MD) and in animal models of stress. Additional data suggest that the glutamatergic system and AMPA receptors specifically, have an important role in modulating the therapeutic effects of mood stabilizers. Further research on the role of AMPA receptors in mood regulation can be done using AMPAkines, positive modulators of AMPA receptors. AMPAkines have been studied for cognitive enhancement in neurodegenerative disorders and some were also examined in preclinical studies of mood disorders. In that context, the present study was designed to test the effects of the AMPAkine CX717 in a strain specific battery of tests for mania-like behaviors.
