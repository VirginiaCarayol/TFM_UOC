Intermittent voluntary wheel running promotes resilience to the negative consequences of repeated social defeat in mice.
A novel approach to reduce the incidence of substance use disorders is to promote resilience to stress using environmental resources such as physical exercise. In the present study we test the hypothesis that Voluntary Wheel Running (VWR) during adolescence blocks the negative consequences of stress induced by intermittent repeated social defeat (IRSD). Four groups of adolescent male C57BL/6 mice were employed in the experiment; two groups were exposed to VWR (1 h, 3 days/week) from postnatal day (PND) 21 until the first social defeat (PND 47), while the remaining two groups did not have access to activity wheels (controls). On PND 47, 50, 53 and 56 mice, who had performed VWR, were exposed to an episode of social defeat by a resident aggressive mouse (VWR+IRSD group) or allowed to explore an empty cage (VWR+EXPL group). The same procedure was performed with control mice that had not undergone VWR (CONTROL+IRSD and CONTROL+EXPL groups). On PND 57, all the mice performed the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM), Hole-Board, Social Interaction, Tail Suspension and Splash tests. After an interval of 3 weeks, all mice underwent a conditioned place preference (CPP) procedure with 1 mg/kg of cocaine. Exposure to VWR prevented the negative consequences of social stress in the EPM, splash test and CPP, since the VWR+IRSD group did not display anxiety- or depression-like effects or the potentiation of cocaine reward observed in the Control+IRSD group. Our results support the idea that physical exercise promotes resilience to stress and represents an excellent target in drug abuse prevention.
