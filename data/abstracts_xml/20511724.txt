Hyperactivity and enhanced curiosity of mice expressing PKB/SGK-resistant glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3).
Mounting evidence suggests that bipolar disorder symptoms could be favorably influenced by modification of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) activity. Specifically, the well known antimanic and mood stabilizing medications lithium, valproate, olanzapine and clozapine have been shown to inhibit GSK-3 activity. GSK-3 is phosphorylated and thus inhibited by protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) and serum and glucocorticoid inducible kinase (SGK) isoforms. The present study explored, whether PKB/SGK-dependent GSK-3 regulation influences the behavior of mice.
