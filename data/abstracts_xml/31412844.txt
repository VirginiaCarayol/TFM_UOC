Xiaoyaosan exerts antidepressant-like effects by regulating the functions of astrocytes and EAATs in the prefrontal cortex of mice.
Mounting evidence indicates that the cerebral cortex is an important physiological system of emotional activity, and its dysfunction may be the main cause of stress. Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS), which initiates rapid signal transmission in the synapse before its reuptake into the surrounding glia, specifically astrocytes (ASTs). The astrocytic excitatory amino acid transporters 1 (EAAT1) and 2 (EAAT2) are the major transporters that take up synaptic glutamate to maintain optimal extracellular glutamic levels, thus preventing accumulation in the synaptic cleft and ensuing excitotoxicity. Growing evidence has shown that excitotoxicity is associated with depression. Therefore, we hypothesized that the underlying antidepressant-like mechanism of Xiaoyaosan (XYS), a Chinese herbal formula, may be related to the regulation of astrocytic EAATs. Therefore, we studied the antidepressant mechanism of XYS on the basis of EAAT dysfunction in ASTs.
