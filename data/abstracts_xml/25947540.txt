A pre-conditioning stress accelerates increases in mouse plasma inflammatory cytokines induced by stress.
Major depressive disorder is a prevalent disease that is inadequately treated with currently available interventions. Stress increases susceptibility to depression in patients and rodent models. Depression is also associated with aberrant activation of inflammation, such as increases in circulating levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα). The two main goals of this study were (i) to identify cytokine changes measuring a broad panel of 19 cytokines, and (ii) to test if a pre-conditioning stress altered the inflammatory response to a subsequent stress.
