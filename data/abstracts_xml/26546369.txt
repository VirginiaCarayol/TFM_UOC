Knockdown of hippocampal cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 prevents depressive behavior and neuroinflammation induced by chronic mild stress in mice.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that neuroinflammation is associated with depression-like symptoms and neuropsychological disturbances, and cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLT1R) was reported to be involved in neuroinflammation. The pathophysiological role of CysLT1R has been reported in several types of brain damage. However, the role of CysLT1R in depression remains to be elucidated.
