Long-lasting behavioral effects and recognition memory deficit induced by chronic mild stress in mice: effect of antidepressant treatment.
Many studies support the validity of the chronic mild stress (CMS) model of depression in rodents. However, most of them focus on analysis of reactivity to rewards during the CMS and/or depressive-like behavior shortly after stress. In this study, we investigate acute and long-term effects of CMS and antidepressant treatment on depressive, anxiety-like behavior and learning.
