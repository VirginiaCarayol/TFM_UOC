Protective effect of hesperidin in a model of Parkinson's disease induced by 6-hydroxydopamine in aged mice.
Parkinson's disease (PD) may be caused by the interaction of a number of factors, including genetics, toxins, oxidative stress, mitochondrial abnormalities, and aging. Studies have shown that consumption of an antioxidant-rich diet may reduce the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of the flavonoid hesperidin in an animal model of PD induced by 6-hidroxidopamine (6-OHDA).
