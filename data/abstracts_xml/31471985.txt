Single housing-induced effects on cognitive impairment and depression-like behavior in male and female mice involve neuroplasticity-related signaling.
Single-housed stress elicits a range of social isolation-related behavioral and neurobiological abnormalities. To investigate single housing-induced behavioral changes and sex differences on stress outcomes, we examined single-housed stress-induced learning and memory impairment, depression-like behaviors, neuroplasticity abnormalities and underlying mechanism. The results showed that male and female mice socially isolated for 8Â weeks had significantly decreased memory acquisition, as demonstrated in the learning curve of the Morris water maze task. Memory consolidation and retrieval were also decreased in both the single-housed male and female mice. These findings were corroborated further by the two classical animal models, Y-maze and novel object recognition tests, as demonstrated by reduced spontaneous alternation and recognition index in both sexes of single-housed mice. Subsequent studies suggested that single-housed male mice exhibited increased immobility time in both the forced swim and tail suspension tests, while the female mice only exhibited increased immobility time in the tail suspension test. Moreover, single-housed stress significantly decreased the apical and basal branch points, dendritic length, and spine density in the CA1 of hippocampal neurons in both male and female mice. These effects were consistent with decreased neuroplasticity and neuroprotective-related molecules such as synaptophysin, PSD95, PKA, pCREB and BDNF expression. These findings suggest that loss of neuronal remodeling and neuroprotective mechanisms due to single housing are involved in behavioral changes in both male and female mice. The results provide further evidence that neuroplasticity-related signaling plays a crucial role in isolation-induced effects on neuropsychiatric behavioral deficits in both sexes.
