The NOP antagonist BTRX-246040 increases stress resilience in mice without affecting adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus.
Nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) is the endogenous ligand of an inhibitory G protein coupled receptor named N/OFQ peptide receptor (NOP). Clinical and preclinical findings suggest that the blockade of the NOP signaling induces antidepressant-like effects. Additionally, the blockade of the NOP receptor during inescapable stress exposure prevented the acquisition of the helplessness phenotype, suggesting that NOP antagonists are able to increase stress resilience. BTRX-246040 (aka LY2940094) is a NOP receptor antagonist with high affinity, potency and selectivity for the NOP over classical opioid receptors. BTRX-246040 is under development for the treatment of depression, eating disorders and alcohol abuse and it already entered clinical trials. In the present study, the antidepressant effects of BTRX-246040 were evaluated in mice subjected to the forced swimming test and to the learned helplessness model of depression. Additionally, the ability of BTRX-246040 to prevent the development of the helpless behavior and to modulate adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been investigated. BTRX-246040 (30Â mg/kg, i.p.) produced antidepressant-like effects in the forced swimming test and in the learned helplessness model. More interestingly, when given before the stress induction sessions it was able to prevent the development of the helplessness behavior. Under these experimental conditions, BTRX-246040 did not modulate adult hippocampal neurogenesis, neither in naive nor in stressed mice. This study, performed with a clinically viable ligand, further corroborates growing evidence indicating that the blockade of the NOP signaling may provide an innovative strategy for the treatment of stress related psychopathologies.
