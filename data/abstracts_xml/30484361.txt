Anemoside A3 rapidly reverses depression-like behaviors and weakening of excitatory synaptic transmission in mouse models of depression.
Developing fast-acting antidepressants attracts considerable attention. Anemoside A3, a natural triterpenoid glycoside isolated from Pulsatillae Radix, has been reported to produce antidepressant-like action in the forced swim test. We herein explore the fast-onset antidepressant-like potentials and antidepressant mechanisms of anemoside A3.
