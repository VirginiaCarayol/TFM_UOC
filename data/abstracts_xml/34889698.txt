Expression and role of microRNA-212/nuclear factor I-A in depressive mice.
Depression is characterized by persistent depressed mood and cognitive dysfunction, severely impacting human health. In the present study, we aimed to explore the role and mechanism of microRNA (miR)-212 in depression in vivo. Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mice were established, and depression-like behaviors were confirmed using the forced swimming test (FST), sucrose preference test (SPT), and the tail suspension test (TST). Next, the expression of miR-212 and its potential target, i.e., nuclear factor I-A (NFIA), was verified using quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR analysis and Western blotting in CUMS mice. The effects of miR-212 and NFIA on depression-like behaviors, inflammatory response, and neuronal apoptosis were examined using FST, TST, SPT, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay, and flow cytometry analysis. Finally, the relationship between miR-212 and NFIA was examined using a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Based on our findings, miR-212 was significantly upregulated, while NFIA was downregulated in CUMS mice. miR-212 overexpression could suppress the CUMS-induced weight loss, immobility time in FST and TST, and increased hippocampal neuronal apoptosis and pro-inflammatory cytokines levels. In addition, NFIA upregulation could partially reverse the effects of miR-212 mimic in CUMS mice. Accordingly, miR-212 could ameliorate CUMS-induced depression-like behavior in mice by targeting NFIA, indicating its protective role in depression.
