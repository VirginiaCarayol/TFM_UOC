Phenotypic assessment of galanin overexpressing and galanin receptor R1 knockout mice in the tail suspension test for depression-related behavior.
Galanin and its receptors exert inhibitory neuromodulatory control over brain monoamines. Rat studies revealed that galanin expression is upregulated by exposure to stressors and that galanin manipulations modify neuroendocrine and behavioral responses to stress, leading to the hypothesis that galanin mediates depression-related behaviors.
