Social defeat stress-induced hyperalgesia is mediated by nav 1.8+ nociceptive fibers.
Recently the voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels began to be studied as possible targets for analgesic drugs. In addition, specific Nav 1.8 blockers are currently being used to treat some types of chronic pain pathologies such as neuropathies and fibromyalgia. Nav 1.8+ fibers convey nociceptive information to brain structures belonging to the limbic system, which is involved in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorders. From this, using a model of chronic social defeat stress (SDS) and intrathecal injections of Nav 1.8 antisense, this study investigated the possible involvement of Nav 1.8+ nociceptive fibers in SDS- induced hyperalgesia in C57/BL mice. Our results showed that SDS induced a depressive-like behavior of social avoidance and increased the sensitivity to mechanical (electronic von Frey test) and chemical (capsaicin test) nociceptive stimuli. We also showed that intrathecal injection of Nav 1.8 antisense reversed the SDS-induced hyperalgesia as demonstrated by both, mechanical and chemical nociceptive tests. We confirmed the antisense efficacy and specificity in a separate no-defeated cohort through real-time PCR, which showed a significant reduction of Nav 1.8 mRNA and no reduction of Nav 1.7 and Nav 1.9 in the L4, L5 and L6 dorsal root ganglia (DRG). The present study advances the understanding of SDS-induced hyperalgesia, which seems to be dependent on Nav 1.8+ nociceptive fibers.
