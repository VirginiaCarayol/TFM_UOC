Obesity Prevents S-Adenosylmethionine-Mediated Improvements in Age-Related Peripheral and Hippocampal Outcomes.
Age predisposes individuals to a myriad of disorders involving inflammation; this includes stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety, and neurodegenerative diseases. Obesity can further exacerbate these effects in the brain. We investigated whether an inexpensive dietary supplement, s-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), could improve age- and/or obesity-related inflammatory and affective measures in the hippocampus.
