Effects of aerobic exercise on depression-like behavior and TLR4/NLRP3 pathway in hippocampus CA1 region of CUMS-depressed mice.
The paper observes regulation of the expression levels of NLRP3 and TLR4 in hippocampal CA1 neurons in CUMS mice by aerobic exercise with constructing CUMS depression mouse model, in order to explore the neuroprotective mechanism of aerobic exercise on the hippocampus of depressed mice.
