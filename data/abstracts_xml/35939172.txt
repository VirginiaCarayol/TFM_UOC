Effect of Epigallocatechin-3-gallate on Stress-Induced Depression in a Mouse Model: Role of Interleukin-1β and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor.
Epigallocatechin 3-gallate (EGCG) is a natural polyphenolic antioxidant in green tea leaves with well-known health-promoting properties. However, the influence of EGCG on a chronic animal model of depression remains to be fully investigated, and the details of the molecular and cellular changes are still unclear. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the antidepressant effect of EGCG in mice subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). After eight consecutive weeks of CUMS, the mice were treated with EGCG (200 mg/kg b.w.) by oral gavage for two weeks. A forced swimming test (FST) was used to assess depressive symptoms. EGCG administration significantly alleviated CUMS-induced depression-like behavior in mice. EGCG also effectively decreased serum interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and increased the mRNA expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampal CA3 region of CUMS mice. Furthermore, electron microscopic examination of CA3 neurons in CUMS mice showed morphological features of apoptosis, loss or disruption of the myelin sheath, and degenerating synapses. These neuronal injuries were diminished with the administration of EGCG. The treatment effect of EGCG in CUMS-induced behavioral alterations was comparable with that of clomipramine hydrochloride (Anafranil), a tricyclic antidepressant drug. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the antidepressive action of EGCG involves downregulation of serum IL-1β, upregulation of BDNF mRNA in the hippocampus, and reduction of CA3 neuronal lesions.
