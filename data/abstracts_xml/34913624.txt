Alpha2-antiplasmin deficiency affects depression and anxiety-like behavior and apoptosis induced by stress in mice.
Depression is a psychiatric disorder that affects about 10% of the world's population and is accompanied by anxiety. Depression and anxiety are often caused by various stresses. However, the etiology of depression and anxiety remains unknown. It has been reported that alpha2-antiplasmin (α2AP) not only inhibits plasmin but also has various functions such as cytokine production and cell growth. This study aimed to determine the roles of α2AP on the stress-induced depression and anxiety.
