Anti-depressive-like effect of 2-phenylethanol inhalation in mice.
Rose oil has traditionally been used to treat psychiatric disorders, but the scientific basis of this treatment remains poorly understood. The main odor component of rose oil is 2-phenylethanol (2-PE), but the neuropsychological effects of 2-PE have not been investigated in detail. Thus, we aimed to investigate the effects of 2-PE on mouse behavior. We first investigated whether 2-PE is attractive or repulsive to mice. After 2-PE inhalation, the mice underwent a series of behavioral experiments, such as the elevated plus maze, open field, Y-maze, tail-suspension, and Porsolt forced-swim tests. Mice did not have a strong interest in 2-PE but were not repelled by it nor were fearful. In the open field test, mice that had inhaled 2-PE spent less time in the center area, while in the tail suspension test, their immobility time decreased. There was no change in cognitive function, activity level, muscle strength, or aggression in these mice. Our results suggest that 2-PE elicits neuropsychological effects that alter the behavior of mice and may also elicit anti-depressive effects. Inhalation of rose oil containing 2-PE may be effective against depression and stress-related diseases.
