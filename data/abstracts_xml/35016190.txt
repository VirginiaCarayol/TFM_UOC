Electroacupuncture Prevents the Depression-Like Behavior by Inhibiting the NF-ÎºB/NLRP3 Inflammatory Pathway in Hippocampus of Mice Subjected to Chronic Mild Stress.
The precise physiological mechanisms of acupuncture in the treatment of depression are still unknown. This study aimed to observe the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) on depression-like behavior of mouse in chronic mild stress (CMS) model and explore the underlying mechanism.
