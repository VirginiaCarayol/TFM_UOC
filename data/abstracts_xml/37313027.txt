Zanthoxylum Alatum Attenuates Chronic Restraint Stress Adverse Behavioral Effects Via the Mitigation of Oxidative Stress and Modulating the Expression of Genes Involved in Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Mice.
The functions of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are important, particularly in the proteins' synthesis, folding, modification, and transport. Based on traditional medicine and our previous studies on Zanthoxylum alatum in lipopolysaccharide-induced depressive behavior and scopolamine-induced impaired memory, the present study explored the role of hydroalcoholic extract of Z. alatum (ZAHA) seeds in reducing the ER stress in mice.
