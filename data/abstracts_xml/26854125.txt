Allosteric Modulation of Sigma-1 Receptors Elicits Rapid Antidepressant Activity.
Sigma-1 receptors are involved in the pathophysiological process of several neuropsychiatric diseases such as epilepsy, depression. Allosteric modulation represents an important mechanism for receptor functional regulation. In this study, we examined antidepressant activity of the latest identified novel and selective allosteric modulator of sigma-1 receptor 3-methyl-phenyl-2, 3, 4, 5-tetrahydro-1H-benzo[d]azepin-7-ol (SOMCL-668).
