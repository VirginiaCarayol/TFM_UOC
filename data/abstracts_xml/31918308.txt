Physical exercise prevents mice from L-Kynurenine-induced depression-like behavior.
Depression is a wide-spread disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Recent studies in neuroinflammation suggested that increased plasma kynurenine (KYN) level was related to depressive symptoms, while animal studies indicated that KYN increase could be caused by environmental stressor. Recent study reported that exercise may prevent stress-induced depression by enhancing KYN metabolism in muscle. This study seeks to test the effect of voluntary exercise on depressive-like behavior induced by stress and KYN in mice.
