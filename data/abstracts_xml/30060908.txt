Chronic Stress Remodels Synapses in an Amygdala Circuit-Specific Manner.
Chronic stress exposure increases the risk of developing various neuropsychiatric illnesses. The behavioral sequelae of stress correlate with dendritic hypertrophy and glutamate-related synaptic remodeling at basolateral amygdala projection neurons (BLA PNs). Yet, though BLA PNs are functionally heterogeneous with diverse corticolimbic targets, it remains unclear whether stress differentially impacts specific output circuits.
