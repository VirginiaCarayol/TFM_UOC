Interleukin-1-induced sickness behavior depends on behavioral lateralization in mice.
Inter-individual differences in brain-immune interactions have been demonstrated previously in mice using lateralization as a behavioral trait of population heterogeneity. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is known to induce neurochemical, neuroendocrine, and immune responses depending on lateralization, is also able to induce sickness behavior, via the production of interleukin-1 (IL-1). The objective of this study was to determine whether lateralization can influence the behavioral response to LPS and to IL-1. To test this hypothesis, adult female C3H mice, previously selected for paw preference in a food reaching task, were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 0.75 microg LPS or 0.75 microg recombinant IL-1beta. Sickness induced by these molecules was measured by depressed social behavior, increased immobility, loss of body weight, and reduced food intake during the 6 h following injection. LPS-induced sickness was similar in right- and left-pawed mice. In contrast, IL-1-induced sickness behavior was dependent on behavioral lateralization. IL-1-induced depression of social investigation was more pronounced in right-pawed mice than in left-pawed animals. Likewise, IL-1-induced immobility was more important in right-pawed mice. There was a similar trend for food intake to be lower and loss of body weight to be higher in right-pawed mice than in left-pawed animals. These results demonstrate that right-pawed mice are more sensitive to IL-1-induced sickness than left-pawed animals. They extend our previous data showing a greater susceptibility to stress of right-pawed animals. The existence of inter-individual differences in the reactivity to stress or immune activation may be useful to study the mechanisms of the various strategies used by an individual in response to environmental aggressions.
